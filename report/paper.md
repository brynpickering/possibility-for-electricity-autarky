# Introduction

Renewable energy, nuclear energy, and carbon capture and storage are the main supply-side options to decarbonise the energy system in Europe. Among these three, renewable energy is the only option to not deplete the energy resource stock it depends on, but its resource offers another unique characteristic: it is available everywhere in some form or another. This allows to generate energy locally, decreases energy imports, and in an extreme case it allows to become energy autarkic, i.e. get rid of energy imports altogether. This is in stark contrast to today's situation, in which the European Union relies on imports for more than half of its energy [@eurostat:2016], with some member states importing more than 90% of their energy. A transition to renewable energy would hence not only allow the European Union, its member states, or regions in Europe to decarbonise their energy systems but also to become autarkic.

Proponents of local energy generation bring up the benefits of increased energy security, improvements to the local economy and its sustainable development, and community involvement. Local generation is understood as a reliable source of energy whose supply but also price is controlled within own borders. As such it decreases the dependency on others and increases the own energy security [@Abegg:2011]. Positive effects on the local economy are expected by the fact that value addition happens within the region which might decrease the outflow of capital. Installation of energy units and their maintenance and operation is furthermore expected to create jobs [@Abegg:2011][@Muller:2011]. The attractiveness of the regions could be strengthened and thereby counteract emigration from peripheral region [@Abegg:2011][@Muller:2011]. Lastly, [@Engelken:2016; @Ecker:2017] show that self-sufficiency is important to the local community, and their involvement in transition processes has shown to improve the willingness to change and reduce public opposition [@Muller:2011; @Rae:2012]. Autarky is often discussed in an on-going debate about decentralisation of the electricity system [@Funcke:2016; @Scheer:2012; @Lilliestam:2016], but decentralisation (in terms of plant sizes and grid structures) and autarky are distinct aspects of the energy system: decentralised systems do not need to be autarkic, and autarkic systems do not need to be decentralised.

There are also arguments against local autarky: the energy demand may rise due to a less efficient use of resources, for example when energy cannot be used or stored locally at the time it is generated. Larger energy systems together with energy cooperation have often shown lower costs [@Czisch:2005; @Patt:2011; @Steinke:2013 @Schmid:2015; @Schlachtberger:2017]. Positive effects on the local economy might be balanced out by the need to import technologies if manufacturing does not happen within the local economy and necessary components and/or expertise need to be imported. Lastly, in their study @Schmidt:2012 show that the land footprint for energy generation is high and can lead to land use conflicts, for example with local food or feed production. Thus, some authors pointed out that the benefits of cooperation and autarky can be combined when full autarky is replaced by local generation embedded in a larger system [@Battaglini:2009; @Schlachtberger:2017].

The stance on energy autarky of one of the largest decision-makers in Europe, the European Commission is communicated through the concept of the Energy Union [@EuropeanCommission:2015]. Regarding autarky on the European level, the Commission aims at lowering its import dependency mainly on oil and nuclear fuel, but it is not targeting full autarky. Instead, the diversity of foreign energy supplier and energy sources shall be increased. Within the EU, the Commission is striving for the establishment of an internal energy market through the harmonisation of market mechanisms, support schemes, and network codes. For electricity, an interconnection target of 10% by 2020 is already in place, which is likely to be increased for the year 2030. This general strategy, which has been refined and amended by a proposal of a recast of the Renewable Energy Directive [@EuropeanCommission:2016c] and a proposal for the governance of the Energy Union [@EuropeanCommission:2016] has only recently been largely agreed upon by the EU member states and the European parliament. With this strategy, the EU is only vaguely striving for EU energy autarky, and certainly not striving for autarky on the national or subnational levels.

Despite the on-going debate whether Europe should strive for autarky to reach potential benefits, we do not know whether energy autarky is technically feasible for Europe, its nations, or regions. The source of uncertainty stems from another characteristic of renewable energy: its large local footprint compared to other sources of energy [@Cho:2010]. We know that energy autarky will require large portions of land in Europe devoted at least partially for energy generation. But whether or not these necessary portions exceed the land that is available in each country, region, or municipality in Europe for them to become autarkic is unknown. And even if autarky is possible, we do not know how much land will be used for energy generation. This makes targeting autarky difficult for European energy policy, as it is not known whether autarky is technically possible at all, and what the implications in terms of land demand and potential land use conflicts would be.

In here, we quantify the potential of renewable electricity in Europe with a high spatial resolution to answer the question of whether electricity autarky is possible in Europe on the European, national, regional, and municipal level, and which amount of land has to be devoted to electricity generation given electricity autarky is possible. We focus on electricity because it is assumed to have the biggest role in future energy systems, considering the pushes for energy efficiency in the heat, and the electrification in the transportation sector. We consider onshore and offshore wind turbines and photovoltaics in our analysis as these technologies revealed the highest potential [@Cho:2010]. The geographic scope of our study comprises of the countries with member organisations in the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E): EU-28, EFTA without Liechtenstein, and Western Balkans countries. We ignore Iceland which has no connection to the mainland and is autarkic electricity-wise. Through the political, organisational, and technical network ENTSO-E provides, the countries of our study have an alternative to national, subnational, or even continental electricity autarky. Because the degree of autarky is largely shaped by political decisions, we assess autarky of regions in Europe with own local government: nations, first-level administrative units on the regional level, and municipalities on the lowest level.

# Literature Review

Evidence for or against electricity autarky in Europe is often collected through case studies on communal level [@Rae:2012; @Muller:2011; @Abegg:2011; @Schmidt:2012] but research is needed on the European level to understand whether and where autarky should be targeted and if yes on which level. Autarky based on renewable electricity is only feasible if enough electricity can be generated locally, i.e. the local potential of renewable electricity is at least as high as the demand. A sufficient potential is hence a necessary condition for autarky and as such a crucial aspect to consider when targeting autarky in any region. Thus, we discuss findings from analyses quantifying renewable electricity potential in the following.

There are different ways of quantifying potentials and depending on the definition, the outcome can vary a lot. A common definition is the one from [@Hoogwijk:2004], which distinguishes between four distinct forms of potentials:

Theoretical potential

:   The first is defined as the magnitude of the resource in the region, for example the total energy content of wind.

Geographical potential

:   The second is defined as the land area suitable for energy generation typically excluding, for example, environmentally protected areas.

Technical potential

:    The part of the theoretical potential on the eligible land that can be transformed to a usable form, e.g. electricity or heat, represents the technical potential.

Economic potential

:    Lastly the part of the technical potential economically viable is called the economic potential.

There are other definitions however: for example in [@EuropeanEnvironmentAgency:2009] the technical potential incorporates all land on which wind turbines can be built without considering constraints from environmental protection. It can hence be understood as the theoretical potential only constrained by technical aspects. Furthermore, definition frameworks are often vague as their classes overlap. [@Defaix:2012] for example considers only roof and fa√ßade areas with optimal yield for determining the technical potential of building integrated PV -- an example that shows how technical constraints cannot always be clearly distinguished from economic constraints. Furthermore potentials depend on the time horizon considered, in particular technical as well as economic potentials as technologies evolve and costs decrease. [@EuropeanEnvironmentAgency:2009] for example considers two different target years with large differences in potential estimations, in particular for offshore wind. Those aspects need to be considered when interpreting potential estimations of renewable electricity.

Solar and wind resources have the highest theoretical potential globally and in Europe [@Cho:2010] and accordingly their constrained potentials are often assessed in order to understand whether autarky is possible on the European level. An early study estimating the potential of electricity from onshore wind in Europe [@Hoogwijk:2004] finds a geographical potential of 530,000 km^2^, a technical potential of 4400 TWh/a, which corresponds roughly to 1.5 times the annual electricity demand in 2001, and an economic potential of not more than 2100 TWh/a, or 0.72 times the demand. A different definition of potentials and a different target year is used by [@EuropeanEnvironmentAgency:2009] leading to drastically different results. The study quantifies the technical and environmentally and economically constrained potential of electricity from on- and offshore wind in Europe. They find a technical potential of 45000 TWh/a for onshore wind in 2030, a potential that is 10-11 times the projected demand. Adding environmental restrictions to the onshore potential has little effect and reduces it to 39000 TWh/a. Lastly, when considering costs and using only the locations which are economically viable leaves 27000 TWh/a in 2030 or 6 times the projected demand. A more recent study [@McKenna:2015] finds a technical potential of 20000 TWh/a for the same countries. While these estimates vary widely from 4400 TWh/a to 39000 TWh/a of environmentally constrained potential, they all agree that onshore wind power could supply a major fraction or all of Europe's electricity demand.

Similar studies have been performed to assess the technical potential of roof mounted photovoltaics (PV) in Europe. Based on statistical information about the building stock and based on solar irradiation data, [@Defaix:2012] estimate a technical potential of 840 TWh/a for the EU-27 including PV mounted on facades, or 22% of the projected demand in 2030. A recent analysis [@Huld:2018] mixes a statistical approach with an analytical one: based on high resolution satellite images for a few cities in Europe they derive a statistical roof model which they then apply to the entire EU-28 using population density as a proxy. This way they find a technical potential for roof mounted PV of 1500 TWh/a, or  35% of the projected demand. These studies show that roof-mounted PV can contribute significantly to supply Europe's electricity needs, albeit at a much lower magnitude than onshore wind. Combined with onshore and offshore wind, all three technologies are likely able to fulfil Europe's electricity demand entirely.

Some of the studies with European scope disaggregate their results on the national level, allowing this way to assess the renewable potential in light of national autarky [@EuropeanEnvironmentAgency:2009; @Defaix:2012; @McKenna:2015]. Other studies have assessed the potential for single countries, e.g. wind in Germany [@McKenna:2014], Spain [@Fueyo:2010], Sweden [@Siyal:2015], and Austria [@Holtinger:2016]. While all of those roughly agree with the results from the analyses on the European level and reveal potentials which are close to or exceeding today's electricity demand, [@Holtinger:2016] shows the importance of the uncertainty of social constraints by involving key stakeholders and decision-makers in the progress of defining them. Their results range from 6% of today's electricity demand in Austria to 147%. Similarly, there are several assessments of national potentials of roof-mounted PV, e.g. 1262 TWh/a [@Quaschning:2000] and 148 TWh/a (residential buildings only) [@Mainzer:2014] for Germany or 18 TWh/a [@Assouline:2017] and 53 TWh/a [@Buffat:2018] for Switzerland. Parts of differences of those results can be explained by different definitions of potentials, other parts by the employed methods. Not for all countries studies are available and thus a European perspective on national potentials is only given by [@EuropeanEnvironmentAgency:2009; @Defaix:2012; @McKenna:2015].

Renewable potentials on regional levels, i.e. the level directly below the national, are given as disaggregated results by [@Assouline:2017; @McKenna:2014] for entire countries. Many more analyses of renewable electricity potentials have been performed on the regional level, e.g. [@Jager:2016; @Ordonez:2010; @Strzalka:2012; @Brito:2012; @Bergamasco:2011]. Those allow to assess the renewable potentials and hence the feasibility of electricity autarky for single regions in Europe, but they do not allow to make general statements for all Europe.

# Method

We assess the feasibility of electricity autarky for regions in Europe with own local government on four levels: European, national, regional, and municipal. For each administrative unit on each administrative level we quantify the renewable potentials and the current electricity demand. We then reject autarky based on renewable electricity for those units for which the annual demand exceeds the annual potential.

## Definition of administrative levels

To identify administrative units including their geographic shape on all levels we use data from Nomenclature of territorial units for statistics 2013 (NUTS 2013) [@eurostat:2015] and the global administrative areas database (GADM) [@GADM:2018]. The scope of our analysis is EU-28 excluding Malta for which no data was available, plus Switzerland, Norway, and the Western Balkans countries Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Macedonia, Montenegro, and Serbia. Together, all 34 countries form the European level; in isolation they form the national level, see Table @tbl:administrative-levels. Country shapes for EU-28 countries and Switzerland and Norway are defined by NUTS 2013, and for the Western Balkans countries by GADM.

The regional level is defined by the first-level administrative divisions, e.g. cantones in Switzerland, r√©gions in France, or oblasti in Bulgaria, of which GADM identifies 493 in the study area. Lastly, there are 122672 communes which form the municipal level. These communes are defined for most countries by the Local Administrative Unit 2 (LAU2) layer of NUTS 2013, and for Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Montenegro we took their definitions from GADM. Lastly, we estimate the size of maritime areas over which administrative units have sovereignty by allocating Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ) to units on all levels. We divide and allocate to all units which share a coast with the EEZ. The share is proportional to the length of the shared coast. We use EEZ shape data from @Claus:2018.

## Renewable potential

To quantify the renewable potential in each administrative unit, we first estimate the amount of land eligible for generation of renewable electricity and then the magnitude of electrical energy that can be generated annually on the eligible land. We will assess three different types of potentials of renewable electricity: the technical potential, a socially and ecologically constrained potential, and the necessary potential to become autarkic. The potentials differ only in the classification of land eligibility, not on any other variable.

### Open field land eligibility

To decide which fractions of the land of an administrative unit can be used for open field PV, or on- and offshore wind farms, we divide Europe into a 10 arcsecond grid, whose cell size varies with the longitude but never exceeds 0.09 km^2^. For each cell we obtain the current land cover and use from the GlobCover 2009 dataset [@EuropeanSpaceAgency:2010], the average slope of the terrain from SRTM and GMTED [@Reuter:2007; @Danielson:2011] or its maximum water depths from ETOPO1 [@Amante:2009], and whether it belongs to an area which is environmentally protected  from the World Database on Protected Areas [@UNEP-WCMC:2018]. We additionally use the European Settlement Map (ESM) with 6.25 m^2^ resolution [@Ferri:2017] to classify an entire 10-arcsecond cell as built-up area if more than 1% of its land area are buildings or urban parks. For each potential type there is a set of rules by which we define if a cell is eligible for renewable electricity generation and if yes, for which type. These rules are described below.

### Roofs for PV

The potential of roof-mounted PV not only depends on the amount of roof areas available, but also on the orientation and the tilt of those roofs. We analytically derive the rooftop areas in each unit. We then use a dataset of Swiss roofs, taking it as representative for Europe as a whole, to correct the area estimation and to amend it with tilt and orientation statistically.

We use the European Settlement Map [@Ferri:2017] to identify the amount of rooftop area in each unit. The map is based on satellite images of 2.5 m resolution and employs auxiliary data e.g. on population or national data on infrastructure to automatically classify each cell as building, street, urban green, etc. For each 10 arcsecond cell we sum up the space that is classified as buildings. We consider only those cells that we initially classified as built-up areas before, and which are hence not used for other renewable generation.

We then amend this first estimation with data from sonnendach.ch for Switzerland [@SwissFederalOfficeofEnergy:2018]. We use this dataset in two ways. First we improve the area estimation taken from the European Settlement Map. This estimation is less precise due to differences in methodology compared to sonnendach.ch, underestimates the area due to a lack of data on roofs' tilt, and overestimates the area as it ignores unavailable parts of the roof, e.g. those covered with windows or chimneys. For the roofs included in the sonnendach.ch dataset, the European Settlement Map identifies 768 km^2^ roof areas, where sonnendach.ch finds only 630 km^2^. After applying the expert estimation of available areas [@SwissFederalOfficeofEnergy:2016], this is reduced to 432 km^2^. Thus, for Switzerland, ESM data overestimates the actual potential by 74%. We assume this overestimation is representative for all Europe and apply the factor of 0.74 to all areas identified by the European Settlement Map.

The second use we make of the Swiss data is to identify the tilt and orientation of the roof areas. For that, we cluster all roofs in 17 categories: flat roofs, and roofs with south-, west-, north-, and east-wards orientation with 4 groups of tilt each. We then quantify the relative area share of each category, see Table @tbl:roof-statistics. We again assume the distribution of these attributes of the Swiss housing stock is representative for Europe and apply it to all administrative units.

### Renewable electricity yield

Based on the previous steps we can quantify the amount of land in each administrative unit that is eligible for generation of renewable electricity. To estimate the annual generation for wind power, we first assume a capacity density of 8 MW/km^2^ (15 MW/km^2^) based on a rated capacity of 2 MW/unit (10 MW/unit) for onshore (offshore) wind [@EuropeanEnvironmentAgency:2009] which allows us to derive the installable capacity for each unit. We then use historically observed capacity factors per NUTS2 unit from renewables.ninja [@Staffell:2016] to determine the annual electricity yield from installable capacity. For offshore wind and for countries in which data on NUTS2 level is not available (Western Balkans, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, and Luxembourg), we use data from the same source on the national level.

For open field PV and flat roof-mounted PV, we assume a capacity density of 80 MW~p~/km^2^ based on a module efficiency of 16% and space demand of two times the module area as an average for all Europe. Furthermore we assume modules are installed southward facing and with tilt optimisation as defined by [@Jacobson:2018]. For PV of tilted roofs, we assume a capacity density of 160 MW~p/km^2^ based on a module efficiency of 16%. Using the statistical model from Table @tbl:roof-statistics we define 16 different deployment situations. We then use renewables.ninja [@Staffell:2016; @Pfenninger:2016] to simulate the average renewable electricity yield of the years 1996-2016 of each deployment situation in each administrative unit of the regional level. In Switzerland for example, this leads to 442 simulated time series, based on 17 deployment situations in 26 cantons. We assume a performance ratio of 90%.

### Technical potential

We first assess the technical potential which is only restricted by technological constraints. To quantify it, we use the following rules: We allow wind farms to be built on farmland, forests, open vegetation and bare land with slope below 20¬∞. An example of exclusion layers for Romania is shown in Figure @fig:exclusion-layers. We furthermore allow open field PV to be built on farmland, vegetation and bare land with slope below 3¬∞. Lastly, we allow offshore wind farms to be built in water depths of less than 50m. Grid cells identified as built-up area can never be used for open field PV or wind farms, only for roof-mounted PV.

![Exclusion layers for determining the potential of wind power in Romania.](../build/exclusion-layers-ROU.png){#fig:exclusion-layers .class}

### Technical-social potential

The technical potential defines an upper bound to the electricity that can be generated in each administrative unit and its definition is relatively straight forward and less controversial. It is hence instructive to study. However, it is a strong overestimation of any feasible potential: in our case, it allows onshore wind and open field PV to be built on all environmentally protected areas, which not only might have severe consequences for the local flora and fauna, but also might breach the directives on habitats [@EuropeanUnion:1992] and birds [@EuropeanUnion:2010] of the European Union, and of several national and regional laws. The technical potential also allows open field PV to be build on farmland causing land use conflicts with food and feed production, and furthermore it allows to use all of the available land, potentially leading to very high densities of electricity generation. In some parts of Europe this leads to all available land being covered with PV modules or wind turbines. Such a scenario is not realistic.

For these reasons we introduce a socially and ecologically constrained potential, in which we prohibit the use of environmentally protected land and we prohibit to build open field PV on farmland. Open field PV can only be built on bare and unused land. Furthermore, only 10% of all available land can be built upon, including maritime regions. We do allow the use of all eligible roof areas for the generation of solar power.

### Necessary potential

Finally, we assess the necessary potential to reach electricity autarky. Not only allows this to understand the implications of electricity autarky in terms of the amount of land that needs to be used for electricity generation, but also it removes uncertainty from the assessment. Quantifying the potential for every administrative unit in Europe has large uncertainties: the assessment is very sensitive to some of the assumptions which in turn may vary between regions in Europe and which are highly uncertain, in particular the amount of available land that can be used for electricity generation [@Holtinger:2016]. When we assess the necessary potential, we do not need to make assumptions on fraction of the land of a unit which can be used for electricity generation.

We assume most of the technical potential to be available but we prohibit open field PV on farmland. Because we focus on land, we ignore wind offshore potentials.

## Current electricity demand

We relate the renewable electricity potential to the local electricity demand of today. As a base, we are using the load data from 2017 for each country [@OpenPowerSystemData:2018] originally published by ENTSO-E. For subnational levels, we allocate the national demand based on the distribution of population in each country. We hence assume that each person in each country is on average consuming the same amount of electricity. Before allocating the national demand based on the distribution of population, we subtract industrial demand of electricity intensive industry.

### Electricity intensive industry

We derive a dataset of electricity intensive industries from the European Emission Trading Scheme (ETS). Using ETS as a base means we are neglecting industries in Switzerland and the Western Balkan countries which do not take part in the scheme. We consider only steel, aluminium, and chloralkali process facilities, which are responsible for more than 0.5% of the respective ETS activity. Based on the ETS address registry and manual research, we identify the exact location of those facilities.

As there is no comprehensive and/or consistent dataset for industry production, we make two important assumptions to determine the production, and hence the electricity demand, of each installation. First, we assume that the product output of each plant is homogenous, corresponding to ‚Äústeel‚Äù, ‚Äúaluminium‚Äù, etc.: we do thus not differentiate between different types of steel or different aluminium products. Hence, each product comes with a generic electricity intensity factor (MWh/t output) which we derive from [@Ecorys:2009; @Paulus:2011; @Eurofer:2015; @Klobasa:2007; @EAA:2012; @Eurochlor:2014]. Second, we assume that the production of each facility is directly proportional to its emissions: a factory emitting 10% of the ETS activity‚Äôs CO~2~ emissions (after all installations contributing 0.5% or less have been removed) is assumed to produce 10% of the output of all facilities in the filtered list under each ETS activity. As base for the yearly European production, we take industry organisation data [@Eurofer:2015; @EAA:2012; @Cembuerau:2015; @Eurochlor:2014; @Paulus:2011] for the most recent year available. For chloralkali plants, we assume the lowest electricity intensity in the range given by @Klobasa:2007, given the efficiency improvements (-8% intensity since 2001) over the last decade [@Eurochlor:2014].

### Population based demand

We use the dataset of industries to localise electricity intensive industrial demand to administrative units. We assume the remaining electricity demand of non-electricity intensive industries, commerce, and households is spatially distributed over the country proportional to population. We use the Global Human Settlement Population Grid which maps population in 2015 with a resolution of 250 m [@JRC:2015] in Europe and globally. It is based on national censuses and population registers. With that, we define the local, annual electricity demand in each administrative unit of each administrative level.

# Results

## Technical potential

We first assess the technical potential of electricity generation from renewable energy at the European level. Aggregating the potential of roof mounted PV, open field PV, and on- and offshore wind results in an electricity yield of almost 160000 TWh/a. With an annual demand of 3203 TWh/a in 2017, this is a huge potential and exceeds the demand almost 50 times. The largest contribution to this potential stems from open field PV, followed by onshore and offshore wind. Roof mounted PV contributes the least.

While the potential exceeds the demand almost 50 times, the resources and the demand are not equally distributed over Europe. Hence, on the national level the technical potential is in some countries greater than in others. Latvia has the highest relative potential, with a yield that exceeds its demand more than 300 times. Switzerland has the lowest relative potential which exceeds its demand less than 3 times. Still, such potentials would allow all countries in Europe to aspire self-sufficiency.

On the regional level, the technical potential is not sufficient to supply all regions with enough electricity. The relative potentials are particularly low for those first-level administrative units which are within city borders. Bruxelles in Belgium, Basel in Switzerland, Vienna in Austria, and Oslo in Norway are the four regions whose technical potential is too low to be self-sufficient. They are shown in red in Figure @fig:sufficient-potentials-map-technical. Other cities with a potential only slightly above their current electricity demand are Berlin, Gen√®ve, and Prague.

![Administrative units where the technical potential is sufficient to supply the electricity demand (green) and where it is insufficient (red), on (a) European, (b) national, (c) regional, and (d) municipal level.](../build/technical-potential/sufficient-potentials-map.png){#fig:sufficient-potentials-map-technical .class}

Despite the abundant potential on the European level, there are many municipalities in Europe for which not even the tolerantly defined technical potential is sufficient to become autarkic, see Figure @fig:sufficient-potentials-map-technical. Roughly 2% of all municipalities are impacted, in which 10% of Europe's population lives, see Table @tbl:impacts-overview-technical. It is largely an issue of densely populated municipalities: 98% of the impacted population lives in municipalities with a population density higher than 1000 people per km^2^. Using the definition of the European Commission and the OECD of the degree of urbanisation (DEGURBA) [@Dijkstra:2014], 93% of the impacted population lives in cities, 7% in towns and suburbs, and 0% in rural areas.

Figure @fig:normed-potentials-boxplots-technical shows the ranges of relative technical potential for all countries when assuming autarky on the municipal level. Each box shows the potential range of those municipalities in which half of the population of the country lives, centred around the median. A quarter of the population lives in municipalities with lower potential and higher potential each. It reveals that not only the total potential per country differs significantly, but also the distribution of the country's potential onto the municipalities varies strongly between countries.

Outliers are not depicted. ](../build/technical-potential/normed-potentials-boxplots.png){#fig:normed-potentials-boxplots-technical .class}

## Technical-social potential

When applying the constraints of the technical-social potential, the total potential on the European level is 14000 TWh/a and hence exceeds today's electricity demand more than 4 times. Because the constraints do not limit roof mounted PV, it contributes the most to this potential, followed by open field PV and on- and offshore wind. Considering these social and environmental constraints, Europe's potential of renewable electricity is by far high enough for Europe to become electricity autarkic.

Also all countries in Europe reveal sufficient potentials: while the technical-social potential, similar to the technical potential, is not equally distributed over Europe, even the lowest relative potential of Switzerland is 50% higher than the national demand. Again we find the highest relative potential in Latvia; a potential that exceeds the national demand 18 times.

We find the lowest relative potentials in those subnational regions which are inside city borders. Oslo reveals the lowest potential, with less than a quarter of its demand supplied with local generation. Other urban areas with insufficient generation are: Bruxelles, Vienna, Basel, Prague, Gen√®ve, √éle-de-France, Dublin, and Berlin, see Figure @fig:sufficient-potentials-map-technical-social. 97% of all 493 first-level administrative units holding 95% of Europe's population have a technical-social potential which exceeds their local demand of today and hence could be self-sufficient, see Table @tbl:impacts-overview-technical-social.

![Administrative units where the technical-social potential is sufficient to supply the electricity demand (green) and where it is insufficient (red), on (a) European, (b) national, (c) regional, and (d) municipal level.](../build/technical-social-potential/sufficient-potentials-map.png){#fig:sufficient-potentials-map-technical-social .class}

While the fraction of municipalities unable to supply themselves with the technical-social potential is only slightly higher, 16% of Europe's population are impacted. The majority of those, 90%, lives in municipalities with a population density above 1000 people per km^2^. According to DEGURBA, 85% of the affected population lives in cities, 12% in towns and suburbs, and only 2% lives in rural areas. Insufficient potential remains an issue of municipalities with high population density.

Figure @fig:normed-potentials-boxplots-technical-social shows the ranges of technical-social potential for all countries when assuming autarky on the municipal. It shows that for some countries, more than a quarter of the population lives in municipalities with insufficient potential. Should the actually feasible potential be lower than this technical-social one, many countries will see many more municipalities with insufficient potentials. The Figure also shows that there are very high relative potentials in Europe, with the median person living in a municipality with a potential more than twice as high as their current electricity demand.

## Necessary potential and land demand

The result of assessing the necessary potential of electricity autarky and land demand it implies are shown in Table @tbl:necessary-land-100 as fractions of the non-built-up areas in each administrative level which are needed for electricity generation. Land demand is generally very low: on the European and national level it is always smaller than 1% of the non-built-up areas and thus almost negligible. On the regional and municipal level there are some administrative units which need all or more of their non-built-up area, but in average the land demand is very low as well. The reason for such limited land needs is the abundant source of electricity from roof-mounted PV which is in many cases able to fulfil the electricity demand on its own.

Many electricity scenarios for Europe consider much lower shares of PV and roof-mounted PV for reasons we will discuss later: in [@EuropeanCommission:2016a; @FraunhoferIEE:2017; @Greenpeace:2012] for example, the share of PV is below 40%. When we consider 40% as a hard limit to the generation of electricity from roof-mounted PV in each administrative unit, we obtain the results as given in Table @tbl:necessary-land-40. Compared to the unconstrained case land demand is much higher on the regional and municipal level, where it increases on average by factor 5. For all Europe and single nations, it remains relatively low with only 2% of all European built-up areas needed in the former case, and up to 10% for single nations. Figure @fig:necessary-land-map-40 visualises the land demand of all units on all four administrative levels. It shows how land demand becomes more concentrated the smaller the autarky level becomes as generation is moving closer to demand centres.

The availability of roof-mounted PV clearly has a major impact not only on land demand generally, but also on the difference in land demand between administrative levels. In Figure @fig:necessary-land-all-layers we thus show results for other diffusions levels of roof-mounted PV from a population centred perspective. The Figure shows the fraction of the European population that lives in administrative units with high electricity generation density which we define as units where a third or more of the non-built-up area is used for electricity farming through wind turbines or open field PV. The Figure reveals strong differences between administrative levels and between diffusion levels of roof-mounted PV. While considering electricity autarky on the national level means that no one in Europe will live in an administrative unit with high electricity generation density, considering autarky on the municipal level will lead to situations in which 4 out of 10 Europeans will have to accept high shares of electricity generation on open land in their commune -- if autarky is at all possible in their municipality. The difference between unconstrained roof-mounted PV and constraining it to 20% of the electricity demand or less is a difference of factor 4 of the population that will live in municipalities with high generation densities.

# Discussion and Conclusion

## Is there enough land to support electricity autarky in Europe?

We have assessed the technical feasibility and the land demand of electricity autarky based on renewable energy on the European, national, regional, and municipal level. Our results show that the potentials of renewable electricity --- a necessary condition for electricity autarky --- are high enough for Europe as a whole and also for all nations to supply themselves with 100% renewable electricity, but in many cases too low to satisfy current demand on the municipal or regional level. This is the case for a tolerantly defined technical potential, but even more so when considering social and ecological constraints. Areas which are unlikely to be able to become autarkic are those with high population density, where available land is sparse and where high electricity demand asks for high magnitudes of generated electricity. Our results furthermore show how higher level autarky on the national level or above allows to relieve the stress on land in those units. On these higher levels, generation is spatially decoupled from demand and can either be more equally distributed on the land, and/or moved to areas with fewer use conflicts. Both findings have shown to be sensitive to the assumed dispersion rate of roof-mounted photovoltaics: large potentials of this technology will improve the situation for lower autarky levels as demand for non-built-up land is reduced.

## Applicability of our findings

The technical feasibility of electricity autarky we assessed is a necessary condition for autarky, but not a sufficient one. This means that areas for which we identified a potential high enough to satisfy demand may in fact not be able to reach autarky, or only with higher land demand. In that sense our approach allows to reject feasibility of autarky but not to confirm it. To confirm the feasibility of autarky, there are technical and economic restrictions to be considered: on the technical side, grid restrictions in the distribution grid or the transmission grid, grid service requirements, and -- maybe most importantly -- balancing needs. Temporal fluctuations of renewable electricity can be balanced by spatial smoothing through larger grids or by temporal smoothing through local storage. Assuming the latter is not available in large scale or costly, balancing needs support autarky on higher levels and thus support our results. We furthermore did not consider economic restrictions and instead used every available potential independent of its levelised cost of electricity. Because several places will actually have high costs, the economic potential is in fact lower than the one we used. For our analysis, these aspect were not relevant, but they must be considered by any analysis that confirms feasibility of electricity autarky in a certain area.

There are trends in the European electricity system that can have a significant effect on our results. On the one hand there are technological improvements which will increase the potential of renewable electricity and thus facilitate autarky on all levels. In our study, we used optimistic wind turbine and PV system parameters, which are ahead of state of the art but which are not bold assumptions. Technology might evolve further than what we assume and pave the way for autarky.

On the other hand, there are divergent trends in the electricity demand: energy efficiency is pushed not only by proponents of autarky [@Rae:2012; @Muller:2011] but also by the European Commission [@EuropeanCommission:2012a] and might decrease demand. Possible reduction from efficiency measures are often seen outweighed by an electrification of the heat and mobility sector. In its reference scenario for 2050, the European Commission assumes an increase of electricity demand of 25% in the period 2015-2050. Such an increase would complicate autarky. We can only speculate which trend will be dominant: rising efficiency in the technologies or the rising electricity demand. Assuming a 25% increase in demand, technology enhancements in particular for photovoltaics are likely to be en par if not dominant [@InternationalEnergyAgency:2010; @Philipps:2017], indicating higher relative potentials might as well be more easily reachable in the future.

Analyses of potentials of renewable electricity on a geographic scope as large as Europe are uncertain. The largest source of uncertainty is likely socio-political acceptance, as shown e.g. by [@Holtinger:2016]. Not only is the impact of acceptance difficult to assess generally, but also it may vary drastically between different parts of Europe depending on local preferences and decision-making. The fidelity of our analysis is thus not high enough to draw definite conclusions on single administrative units; a detailed local analysis will always be necessary for that.

However, our main findings are not sensitive to this type of uncertainty. Our findings show the relative difference between administrative levels which is largely driven by the geographic scale of each administrative level and the population distribution. This relative relationship persists estimation errors in the total European potential of renewable electricity. For the estimation of the land demand of electricity autarky, we need hardly any assumptions on social constraints of renewable electricity.

## Implications

While renewable energy resources are abundant in Europe, electricity autarky below the national level is likely not possible: regions and municipalities have insufficient potential or need large fractions or all of their available land to become autarkic. A workaround for this issue could be to form electricity regions in which urban areas cooperate with their surrounding municipalities. In such electricity regions the surrounding municipalities could generate surplus energy and export it into the city. The necessary size of such electricity regions is unknown and depends on the current and maximum density of the surrounding municipalities.

Even if forming electricity regions is an option, our findings show how they would lead to high generation density in and around the urban area as supply is spatially coupled with demand. Even without electricity generation, these metropolitan areas already are under high stress on available land and electricity generation would cause further stress and potential land use conflicts. Electricity autarky on the national level or above allows to spatially decouple demand and supply and electricity generation can hence distributed more freely.

Very high shares of building integrated PV, for example by using all rooftops for electricity generation, and/or by additionally using the fa√ßades of buildings, and/or by technological improvements and higher efficiencies would ease autarky on lower levels, but only assuming balancing issues of electricity systems with very high PV shares of more than 80% can be handled. There is no study that has investigated that for all Europe, but case studies have already shown this to be difficult for single regions and we speculate that balancing costs would be high.

Instead, our results suggest high rates of self-sufficiency should be aspired instead of full electricity autarky, where electricity is generated locally as much as possible and without causing stress on available land, and electricity imports are used to satisfy the remaining demand. In such a system, benefits of local generation can be combined with benefits of cooperation by which electricity can be generated on land with fewer use conflicts. Such a system structure is in line with suggestions from former studies [@Battaglini:2009]. To reach a system like that, energy policy must support local generation but in the same time build up a framework for electricity cooperation in Europe.
