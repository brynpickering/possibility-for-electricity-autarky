# Introduction

Renewable energy, nuclear energy, and fossil fuels combustion amended by carbon capture and storage all are options to decarbonise the energy system in Europe. Among those three, renewable energy is the only option to not deplete the energy resource stock it depends on, but its resource offers another unique characteristic: it is available everywhere in some form or another. This allows to generate energy locally, decreases energy imports, and in an extreme case it allows to become energy autarkic, i.e. get rid of energy imports altogether. This is in stark contrast to today's situation, in which the European Union relies on imports for more than half of its energy [@eurostat:2016], with some member states importing more than 90% of their energy. A transition to renewable energy would hence not only allow the European Union, its member states, or regions in Europe to decarbonise their energy systems but also to become autarkic.

Proponents of local energy generation bring up the benefits of increased energy security, improvements to the local economy and its sustainable development, and community involvement. Local generation is understood as a reliable source of energy whose supply but also price is controlled within own borders. As such it decreases the dependency on others and increases the own energy security [@Abegg:2011]. Positive effects on the local economy are expected by the fact that value addition happens within the region which might decrease the out flow of capital. Installation of energy units and their maintenance and operation is furthermore expected to create jobs [@Abegg:2011][@Muller:2011]. The attractiveness of the regions could be strengthened and thereby counteract emigration in peripheral regions and promote tourism [@Abegg:2011][@Muller:2011]. Lastly, the involvement of the local community in the transition process has shown to improve the willingness to change and reduce public opposition [@Muller:2011; @Rae:2012].

There are also arguments against local autarky, some of which are discussed by @Schmidt:2012 for autarky on a small scale: the energy demand may rise due to an inherently less efficient use of resources, for example when energy cannot be used or stored locally at the time it is generated. Positive effects on the local economy might be balanced out by the need to import technologies as long as manufacturing does not happen within the local economy and necessary resources need to be imported. Lastly, in their study @Schmidt:2012 show that the land footprint for energy generation is high and can lead to land use conflicts, for example with local food or feed production.

Evidence for or against energy autarky in Europe is often collected through case studies on communal level [@Rae:2012; @Muller:2011; @Abegg:2011; @Schmidt:2012] but research is needed on the European level to understand whether and where autarky should be targeted and if yes on which level.

Autarky based on renewable energy is only feasible if enough energy can be generated locally, i.e. the local potential of renewable energy is at least as high as the demand. A sufficient potential is hence a necessary condition for autarky and as such a crucial aspect to consider when targeting autarky in any region. There are different ways of quantifying potentials and depending on the definition, the outcome can vary a lot. A common definition is the one from [@Hoogwijk:2004], which distinguishes between the theoretical, geographical, technical, and economic potential. The first is defined as the magnitude of the resource in the region, for example the total energy content of wind. The second is defined as the land area suitable for energy generation typically excluding, for example, environmentally protected areas. The part of the theoretical potential on the eligible land that can be transformed to a usable form, e.g. electricity or heat, represents the technical potential. Lastly the part of the technical potential economically viable is called the economic potential. There are other definitions though: for example in [@EuropeanEnvironmentAgency:2009] the technical potential incorporates all land on which wind turbines can be build without considering constraints from environmental protection. It can hence be understood as the theoretic potential only constrained by technical aspects. Furthermore, definition frameworks are often vague as their classes overlap: for example technical constraints cannot always be clearly distinguished from economic constraints. Also some potentials depend on the time horizon considered, in particular technical as well as economic potentials as technologies evolve and costs decrease. Those aspects need to be considered when interpreting potential estimations of renewable energy.

Solar and wind resources have the highest theoretical potential globally and in Europe [@Cho:2010] and accordingly their constrained potentials are often assessed in order to understand whether autarky is possible on the European level. An early study estimating the potential of electricity from onshore wind in Europe [@Hoogwijk:2004] finds a geographical potential of 530,000 km^2^, a technical potential of 4400 TWh/a, which corresponds roughly to 1.5 times the annual electricity demand in 2001, and an economic potential of not more than 2100 TWh/a, or 0.72 times the demand. A different definition of potentials and a different target year is used by [@EuropeanEnvironmentAgency:2009] leading to drastically different results. The study quantifies the technical and environmentally and economically constrained potential of electricity from on- and offshore wind in Europe. They find a technical potential of 45000 TWh/a for onshore wind in 2030, a potential that is 10-11 times the projected demand. Adding environmental restrictions to the onshore potential has little effect and reduces it to 39000 TWh/a. Lastly, when considering costs and using only the locations which are economically viable leaves 27000 TWh/a in 2030 or 6 times the projected demand. A more recent study [@McKenna:2015] finds a technical potential of 20000 TWh/a for the same countries. While these estimates vary widely from 4400 TWh/a to 39000 TWh/a of environmentally constrained potential, they all agree that onshore wind power could supply a major fraction or all of Europe's electricity demand.

Similar studies have been performed to assess the technical potential of roof mounted photovoltaics (PV) in Europe. Based on statistical information about the building stock and based on solar irradiation data, [@Defaix:2012] estimate a technical potential of 840 TWh/a for the EU-27 including PV mounted on facades, or 22% of the projected demand in 2030. A recent analysis [@Huld:2018] mixes a statistical approach with an analytical one: based on high resolution satellite images for a few cities in Europe they derive a statistical roof model which they then apply to the entire EU-28 using population density as a proxy. This way they find a technical potential for roof mounted PV of 1500 TWh/a, or  35% of the projected demand. These studies show that roof-mounted PV can contribute significantly to supply Europe's electricity needs, albeit at a much lower magnitude than onshore wind.

Some of the studies with European scope disaggregate their results on the national level, allowing this way to assess the renewable potential in light of national autarky [@EuropeanEnvironmentAgency:2009; @Defaix:2012; @McKenna:2015]. Other studies have assessed the potential for single countries, e.g. wind in Germany [@McKenna:2014], Spain [@Fueyo:2010], Sweden [@Siyal:2015], and Austria [@Holtinger:2016]. While all of those roughly agree with the results from the analyses on the European level and reveal potentials which are close to or exceeding today's electricity demand, [@Holtinger:2016] shows the uncertainty of social constraints by involving key stakeholders and decision-makers in the progress of defining them. Their results range from 3.9 TWh/a or ~6% of today's electricity demand to 92.8 TWh/a or 147%. Similarly, there are several assessments of national potentials of roof-mounted PV, e.g. 1262 TWh/a [@Quaschning:2000] and 148 TWh/a (residential buildings only) [@Mainzer:2014] for Germany or 17.86 TWh/a [@Assouline:2017] and 53.2 TWh/a [@Buffat:2018] for Switzerland. Part of differences of those results can be explained by different definitions of potentials, other parts by the employed methods. Not for all countries studies are available and thus a European perspective on national potentials is only given by [@EuropeanEnvironmentAgency:2009; @Defaix:2012; @McKenna:2015].

Renewable potentials on subnational levels are given as disaggregated results by [@Assouline:2017; @McKenna:2014] for entire countries. Many more analyses of renewable energy potentials have been performed on the regional level, e.g. [@Jager:2016; @Ordonez:2010; @Strzalka:2012; @Brito:2012; @Bergamasco:2011]. Those allow to assess the renewable potentials and hence the feasibility of electricity autarky for single regions in Europe, but they do not allow to make general statements for all Europe.

There is no study known to us which assesses the potential of electricity from renewable sources in Europe disaggregated to a subnational level. General statements on the feasibility of electricity autarky on such a level can hence not be made. Furthermore, none of the studies compares the implications of autarky at different levels, not even between the national and the European level. In this paper, we quantify the socially and environmentally constrained potential for wind power and photovoltaics in Europe, assess the feasibility of electricity autarky in all regions on different levels, and discuss implications of decisions for certain levels of electricity autarky.

# Method

The degree of local electricity autarky in a region in Europe is shaped by political decisions: despite the liberalised energy market, support schemes and concessions can foster or hinder local generation and storage. Similarly, strong collaboration and trading between regions -- the alternative to autarky -- requires the deployment and maintenance of sufficient transfer capacities, which remains a public responsibility despite the liberalisation. We therefore analyse regions in Europe with their own administration on four levels: European, national, regional, and municipal. For each administrative unit on each administrative level we quantify the renewable potentials and the current electricity demand. We then reject autarky based on renewable electricity for those units for which the annual demand exceeds the annual potential.

To identify administrative units including their geographic shape on all levels we use data from NUTS 2013 [@eurostat:2015] and the global administrative areas database (GADM) [@GADM:2018]. The scope of our analysis is EU-28 excluding Malta for which no data was available, plus Switzerland, Norway, and the Balkan countries Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Macedonia, Montenegro, and Serbia. Together, they form the European level; in isolation they form the national level. Country shapes for EU-28 countries and Switzerland and Norway are defined by NUTS 2013, and for the balkan countries by GADM. The regional level is defined by the first-level administrative divisions, e.g. cantones in Switzerland, régions in France, or oblasti in Bulgaria, of which GADM identifies 570 in the study area. Lastly, 124404 communes in the 34 countries form the municipal level. These communes are defined for most countries by the Local Administrative Unit 2 (LAU2) layer of NUTS 2013, and for Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Montenegro we took their definitions from GADM. Lastly, we estimate the size of maritime areas over which regions have sovereignty by allocating Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ) to regions on all levels. We divide and allocate to all regions which share a coast with the EEZ. The share is proportional to the length of the shared coast. We use EEZ shape data from @Claus:2018.

## Renewable potential

To quantify the renewable potential in each administrative unit, we first estimate the amount of land eligible for generation of renewable electricity and then the magnitude of electrical energy that can be generated annually on the eligible land.

### Open field land eligibility

To decide which fractions of the land of an administrative unit can be used for open field PV, or on- and offshore wind farms, we divide Europe in a grid of 10 arcseconds resolution, whose cell size varies with the longitude but never exceeds 0.09 km^2^. For each cell we derive the current land cover and use [@EuropeanSpaceAgency:2010], the average slope of the terrain [@Reuter:2007; @Danielson:2011] or its maximum water depths [@Amante:2009], and whether it belongs to an area which is environmentally protected [@UNEP-WCMC:2018]. We prohibit energy generation next to settlements by amending the coarse land cover data with more detailed data on settlements with a cell size of 6.25m^2^ [@Ferri:2017]. Using this dataset we classify each 10 arcseconds cell as built-up area when more than 1% of its land are buildings or urban parks and prohibit energy generation on it. To quantify the technical potential, we use the following rules: We allow wind farms to be built on farmland, forests, open vegetation and bare land with slope below 20°. An example of exclusion layers for Switzerland is shown in Figure @fig:exclusion-layers. We furthermore allow open field PV to be built on farmland, vegetation and bare land with slope below 3°. Lastly, we allow offshore wind farms to be built in water depths of less than 50m. For environmentally and socially restricted potentials, we limit the land eligibility for renewable electricity further, for example by prohibiting the use of environmentally protected land or the use of farmland for open field PV as it may lead to land use conflicts.

### Roofs for PV

The potential of roof-mounted PV not only depends on the amount of roof areas available, but also on the orientation and the tilt of those roofs. We mix an analytical approach with a statistical one to derive the potential. First, we analytically derive the rooftop areas in each unit. We then use a data set of Swiss roofs to correct the area estimation and to amend it with tilt and orientation statistically.

We use the European Settlement Map (ESM) [@Ferri:2017] to identify the amount of rooftop area in each unit. The map is based on satellite images of 2.5m resolution and employs auxiliary data e.g. on population or national data on infrastructure to automatically classify each cell as building, street, urban green, etc. For each of our 10 arcseconds cells we sum up the space that is classified as buildings. We are considering only those cells that had been classified as built-up areas before and which are hence not used for other renewable generation.

We then amend this first estimation with data from sonnendach.ch for Switzerland [@SwissFederalOfficeofEnergy:2018]. We use this dataset in two ways: First we improve the area estimation based on the European Settlement Map. This estimation is less precise due to the coarse methodology compared to sonnendach.ch, underestimates the area due to a lack of tilt, and overestimates the area as it ignores unavailable parts of the roof, e.g. those covered with windows or chimneys. For the roofs included in the sonnendach.ch dataset, the European Settlement Map identifies 768km^2^ roof areas, where sonnendach.ch finds only 630km^2^. After applying the expert estimation of available areas [@SwissFederalOfficeofEnergy:2016], this is reduced to 441km^2^ (TODO update!). The ESM data overestimates the actual potential hence by 74%. We assume this overestimation is representative for all Europe and apply this factor to all areas identified by the European Settlement Map.

The second use we make out of the Swiss data is to identify the tilt and orientation of the roof areas. For that, we cluster all roofs in 17 categories: flat roofs, and roofs with south-, west-, north-, and east-wards orientation with 4 groups of tilt each. We then quantify the relative area share of each category, see Table @tbl:roof-statistics. We again assume the distribution of these attributes of the Swiss housing stock is representative for Europe and apply it to all regions.

### Renewable electricity yield

Based on the previous steps we can quantify the amount of land in each administrative unit that is eligible for generation of renewable electricity. To estimate the annual generation for wind power, we first assume a capacity density of 8 MW/km^2^ and 15 MW/km^2^ for onshore and offshore wind respectively [@EuropeanEnvironmentAgency:2009] which allows us to derive the installable capacity for each unit. We then use historically observed capacity factors per NUTS2 region (respectively per country on the Western Balkan) from renewables.ninja [@Staffell:2016] to determine the annual electricity yield from installable capacity.

For open field PV and flat roof-mounted PV, we assume a capacity density of ?? MWp/km^2^, southward facing and with tilt optimisation as defined by [@Jacobson:2018]. For PV of tilted roofs, we assume a capacity density of ?? MWp/km^2^ and we use the statistical model from Table @tbl:roof-statistics to derive 16 different deployment situations. We then use renewables.ninja [@Staffell:2016; @Pfenninger:2016] to simulate the renewable electricity yield of each deployment situation in each administrative unit of the regional level. In Switzerland for example, this leads to 442 simulations, based on 17 deployment situations in 26 cantons.

The aggregated yield of onshore wind, offshore wind, open field PV and roof-mounted PV represents the technical renewable electricity potential for each administrative unit.

## Current electricity demand

We relate the renewable electricity potential to the local electricity demand of today. As a base, we are using the load data from 2017 for each country [@OpenPowerSystemData:2018] originally published by ENTSO-e. For subnational levels, we upsample the data by the use of a dataset on demand of electricity intensive industries and on population in Europe.

We derive the dataset of electricity intensive industries from the European Emission Trading Scheme (ETS). Using ETS as a base means we are neglecting industries in Switzerland and the Western Balkan countries which do not take part in the scheme. We consider those steel, aluminium, and chloralkali factories, that are responsible for more than 0.5% of the respective ETS activity. Based on the ETS address registry and manual research, we identify the exact location of those factories.

As there is no comprehensive and/or consistent data set for industry production, we make two important assumptions to determine the production, and hence the electricity demand, of each installation. First, we assume that the product output of each plant is homogenous, corresponding to “steel”, “aluminium”, etc.: we do thus not differentiate between different types of steel or different aluminium products. Hence, each product comes with a generic electricity intensity factor (MWh/t output) which we derive from [@Ecorys:2009; @Paulus:2011; @Eurofer:2015; @Klobasa:2007; @EAA:2012; @Eurochlor:2014]. Second, we assume that the production of each facility is directly proportional to its emissions: a factory emitting 10% of the Activity’s CO~2~ emissions (after all installations contributing 0.5% or less have been removed) is assumed to produce 10% of the output of all facilities in the filtered list under each Activity. As base for the yearly European production, we take industry organisation data [@Eurofer:2015; @EAA:2012; @Cembuerau:2015; @Eurochlor:2014; @Paulus:2011] for the most recent year available. For chloralkali plants, we assume the lowest electricity intensity in the range given by @Klobasa:2007, given the efficiency improvements (-8% intensity since 2001) over the last decade [@Eurochlor:2014].

We use the dataset of industries to localise electricity intensive industrial demand to administrative units. We assume the remaining electricity demand of non electricity intensive industries, commerce, and households is spatially distributed over the country proportional to the population. We use the Global Human Settlement Population Grid which maps population in 2015 with a resolution of 250m [@JRC:2015] in Europe and globally. It is based on national censuses and population registers. With that, we define the local, annual electricity demand in each administrative unit of each administrative level.

Leaving out environmental protection only helps 0.6% of Europe's population.

How low can we go with the 10% to have a large impact?

# Conclusion

TODO somewhere here discuss future trends that might become important: rising electricity demand from heat and mobility (important), urbanisation (important, but not huge), other technologies, energy efficiency (mentioned by several proponents of autarky, e.g. [@Rae:2012][@Muller:2011]

TODO somewhere here discuss technical restrictions: distribution and transmission grid, intermittency of renewable infeed

TODO somewhere here discuss economic restrictions: LCOE e.g. from slope, access to roads, magnitude of resources (north facing rooftop pv anyone?). What does that mean for autarky?

TODO somewhere here discuss short comings of this approach: [@Holtinger:2016] e.g. reports that distance to settlements in Austria and Germany have a large impact; ignoreing suitable zones;

the whole thing is mainly a problem of densely populated regions. rooftop pv is of major importance. as long as enough rooftop pv can be build, land demand is low for most municipalities. should less rooftop pv be useable, e.g. due to technical issues discussed above, many municipalities will need to use much higher shares of their land.
