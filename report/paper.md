# Introduction

Renewable energy, nuclear energy, and carbon capture and storage are the main supply-side options to decarbonise the energy system in Europe. Among these three, renewable energy is the only option to not deplete the energy resource stock it depends on, but its resource offers another unique characteristic: it is available everywhere in some form or another. This allows to generate energy locally, decreases energy imports, and in an extreme case it allows to become energy autarkic, i.e. get rid of energy imports altogether. This is in stark contrast to today's situation, in which the European Union relies on imports for more than half of its energy [@eurostat:2016], with some member states importing more than 90% of their energy. A transition to renewable energy would hence not only allow the European Union, its member states, or regions in Europe to decarbonise their energy systems but also to become autarkic.

Proponents of local energy generation bring up the benefits of increased energy security, improvements to the local economy and its sustainable development, and community involvement. Local generation is understood as a reliable source of energy whose supply but also price is controlled within own borders. As such it decreases the dependency on others and increases the own energy security [@Abegg:2011]. Positive effects on the local economy are expected by the fact that value addition happens within the region which might decrease the outflow of capital. Installation of energy units and their maintenance and operation is furthermore expected to create jobs [@Abegg:2011][@Muller:2011]. The attractiveness of the regions could be strengthened and thereby counteract emigration from peripheral region [@Abegg:2011][@Muller:2011]. Lastly, [@Engelken:2016; @Ecker:2017] show that self-sufficiency is important to the local community, and their involvement in transition processes has shown to improve the willingness to change and reduce public opposition [@Muller:2011; @Rae:2012]. Autarky is often discussed in an on-going debate about decentralisation of the electricity system [@Funcke:2016; @Scheer:2012; @Lilliestam:2016], but decentralisation (in terms of plant sizes and grid structures) and autarky are distinct aspects of the energy system: decentralised systems do not need to be autarkic, and autarkic systems do not need to be decentralised.

There are also arguments against local autarky: the energy demand may rise due to a less efficient use of resources, for example when energy cannot be used or stored locally at the time it is generated. Larger energy systems together with energy cooperation have often shown lower costs [@Czisch:2005; @Patt:2011; @Steinke:2013 @Schmid:2015; @Schlachtberger:2017]. Positive effects on the local economy might be balanced out by the need to import technologies if manufacturing does not happen within the local economy and necessary components and/or expertise need to be imported. Lastly, in their study @Schmidt:2012 show that the land footprint for energy generation is high and can lead to land use conflicts, for example with local food or feed production. Thus, some authors pointed out that the benefits of cooperation and autarky can be combined when full autarky is replaced by local generation embedded in a larger system [@Battaglini:2009; @Schlachtberger:2017].

The stance on energy autarky of one of the largest decision-makers in Europe, the European Commission is communicated through the concept of the Energy Union [@EuropeanCommission:2015]. Regarding autarky on the European level, the Commission aims at lowering its import dependency mainly on oil and nuclear fuel, but it is not targeting full autarky. Instead, the diversity of foreign energy supplier and energy sources shall be increased. Within the EU, the Commission is striving for the establishment of an internal energy market through the harmonisation of market mechanisms, support schemes, and network codes. For electricity, an interconnection target of 10% by 2020 is already in place, which is likely to be increased for the year 2030. This general strategy, which has been refined and amended by a proposal of a recast of the Renewable Energy Directive [@EuropeanCommission:2016c] and a proposal for the governance of the Energy Union [@EuropeanCommission:2016] has only recently been largely agreed upon by the EU member states and the European parliament. With this strategy, the EU is only vaguely striving for EU energy autarky, and certainly not striving for autarky on the national or subnational levels.

Despite the on-going debate whether Europe should strive for autarky to reach potential benefits, we do not know whether energy autarky is technically feasible for Europe, its nations, or regions. The source of uncertainty stems from another characteristic of renewable energy: its large local footprint compared to other sources of energy [@Cho:2010]. We know that energy autarky will require large portions of land in Europe devoted at least partially for energy generation. But whether or not these necessary portions exceed the land that is available in each country, region, or municipality in Europe for them to become autarkic is unknown. And even if autarky is possible, we do not know how much land will be used for energy generation. This makes targeting autarky difficult for European energy policy, as it is not known whether autarky is technically possible at all, and what the implications in terms of land use and potential land use conflicts would be.

In this article, we quantify the potential of renewable electricity in Europe with a high spatial resolution to answer the question of whether electricity autarky is possible in Europe on the European, national, regional, and municipal level, and which amount of land has to be devoted to electricity generation given electricity autarky is possible. We focus on electricity because it is assumed to have the biggest role in future energy systems, considering the pushes for energy efficiency in the heat, and the electrification in the transportation sector. We consider onshore and offshore wind turbines and photovoltaics in our analysis as these technologies revealed the highest potential [@Cho:2010]. The geographic scope of our study comprises of the countries with member organisations in the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E): EU-28, EFTA without Liechtenstein, and Western Balkans countries. We ignore Iceland which has no connection to the mainland and is autarkic electricity-wise. Through the political, organisational, and technical network ENTSO-E provides, the countries of our study have an alternative to national, subnational, or even continental electricity autarky. Because the degree of autarky is largely shaped by political decisions, we assess autarky of regions in Europe with own local government: nations, first-level administrative units on the regional level, and municipalities on the lowest level.

# Literature Review

Arguments for or against electricity autarky in Europe are often supported through case studies on municipal level [@Rae:2012; @Muller:2011; @Abegg:2011; @Schmidt:2012] but research is needed on the European scale to understand on which level autarky is possible and to understand the land tradeoff that has to be made. Autarky based on renewable electricity is only possible if enough electricity can be generated locally, i.e. the annual potential for renewable electricity generation is at least as high as the annual demand. A sufficient potential is hence a necessary condition for autarky and as such a crucial aspect to consider when targeting autarky in any region. We acknowledge that, if the potential in an area is sufficient, autarky may still be impossible or impractical, for example when taking fluctuations of renewables into account. Here, we only discuss the necessary condition of sufficient potentials. Thus, we discuss findings from analyses quantifying renewable electricity potential in the following.

There are different kinds of potentials that have been assessed: theoretical, geographical, technical, and economic. To analyse the possibility of autarky, the most important kind is the technical potential. It defines the amount of renewable energy that can be transformed to electricity given technological restrictions. There is no consensus for this definition however: in [@Hoogwijk:2004] for example, the technical potential does not include electricity that could be generated on environmentally protected areas, whereas in [@EuropeanEnvironmentAgency:2009] it does. For roof-mounted PV, north-facing roof areas are sometimes included in the calculation of the technical potential [@Buffat:2018] and sometimes not [@Defaix:2012]. The different definitions, but also different assumptions, can lead to diverging results.

We are not aware of studies assessing technical potentials in the context of electricity autarky on the European scale, but there are studies that assessed technical potentials of single technologies in Europe. For onshore wind, they find 4,400 TWh/a [@Hoogwijk:2004], 20,000 TWh/a [@McKenna:2015], and 45,000 TWh/a  [@EuropeanEnvironmentAgency:2009]. The relatively low estimate of the first study can be explained by two factors: first, they exclude areas with average wind speeds below 4 m^2^ at 10 m hub height. Second, they exclude environmentally protected areas and use available agricultural land and forests only partially. Combined, these two constraints exclude around 90% of Europe's land. Despite the differences in the definitions, they all agree that onshore wind power could supply a major fraction or all of Europe's current electricity demand of around 3,000 TWh/a.

The potential of roof-mounted PV has also been assessed on the European level. They find 840 TWh/a [@Defaix:2012] and 1,500 TWh/a [@Huld:2018]. The difference in their results is explained by their different geographical scopes, by the fact that the former ignores north-facing areas, and by their different methods: while the former uses a statistical approach to quantify available roof areas, the latter uses high resolution satellite images for a few cities in Europe to derive their roof areas and then extrapolates these results using population density as a proxy. The studies show that roof-mounted PV can contribute significantly to supply Europe's electricity needs, albeit at a much lower magnitude than onshore wind. Combined with onshore wind, both technologies are likely able to fulfil Europe's electricity demand entirely.

Some of the studies with European scope disaggregate their results on the national level, allowing this way to assess the renewable electricity potential in light of national autarky [@EuropeanEnvironmentAgency:2009; @Defaix:2012; @McKenna:2015]. Other studies have assessed the potential for single countries, e.g. wind in Germany [@McKenna:2014], Spain [@Fueyo:2010], Sweden [@Siyal:2015], and Austria [@Holtinger:2016]. All of those roughly agree with the results from the analyses on the European level and reveal potentials which are close to or exceeding today's electricity demand. Again others have assessed national potentials of roof-mounted PV, e.g. 1,262 TWh/a [@Quaschning:2000] and 148 TWh/a (residential buildings only) [@Mainzer:2014] for Germany or 18 TWh/a [@Assouline:2017] and 53 TWh/a [@Buffat:2018] for Switzerland. Not for all countries studies are available and thus a European perspective on national potentials is only given by [@EuropeanEnvironmentAgency:2009; @Defaix:2012; @McKenna:2015].

On the regional and municipal level, there are some studies assessing the potentials for entire countries [@Assouline:2017; @McKenna:2014], but most studies focus on single regions or municipalities, e.g. [@Jager:2016; @Ordonez:2010; @Strzalka:2012; @Brito:2012; @Bergamasco:2011]. No study has been performed that assesses renewable electricity potentials on the regional or municipal level but with an European scope.

# Methods and data

We assess the possibility of electricity autarky for administrative units in Europe on four levels: European, national, regional, and municipal. For each administrative unit on each administrative level we quantify the renewable potentials and the current electricity demand. We then reject autarky based on renewable electricity for those units for which the annual demand exceeds the annual potential.

## Definition of administrative levels

To identify administrative units including their geographic shape on all levels we use NUTS (Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics) 2013 data [@eurostat:2015] and the lobal administrative areas database (GADM) [@GADM:2018]. The scope of our analysis is EU-28 excluding Malta for which no data was available, plus Switzerland, Norway, and the Western Balkans countries Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Macedonia, Montenegro, and Serbia. Together, all 34 countries form the European level; in isolation they form the national level (see Table @tbl:administrative-levels). Country shapes for EU-28 countries, Switzerland and Norway are defined by NUTS 2013, and for the Western Balkans countries by GADM.

The regional level is defined by the first-level administrative divisions, e.g. cantons in Switzerland, régions in France, or oblasti in Bulgaria, of which GADM identifies 502 in the study area. Macedonia and Montenegro only have one subnational administrative level --- the municipal level --- which in our analysis is below the regional level. For Macedonia we thus use a statistical division from NUTS3 larger than the municipal level, and for Montenegro we use the municipal level from GADM as no alternative is available. Lastly, there are 122635 communes which form the municipal level. These communes are defined for most countries by the Local Administrative Unit 2 (LAU2) layer of NUTS 2013, and for Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Macedonia, and Montenegro, we take their definitions from GADM. Lastly, we estimate the size of maritime areas over which administrative units have sovereignty by allocating Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ) to units on all levels. Within a country, we divide the EEZ and allocate parts to all subnational units which share a coast with the EEZ. The share is proportional to the length of the shared coast. We use EEZ shape data from @Claus:2018.

## Renewable electricity potential

To quantify the renewable electricity potential in each administrative unit, we first estimate the amount of land eligible for generation of renewable electricity and then the magnitude of electricity that can on average be generated annually on the eligible land. We assess two types of potentials of renewable electricity: the technical potential and a socially constrained potential. The only difference between these potentials is the classification of land eligibility, i.e. the amount of land available for renewable electricity generation. We furthermore assess the necessary land use when assuming electricity autarky, i.e. the amount of non-built-up land that is needed for electricity generation to become autarkic.

### Open field land eligibility

To decide which fractions of the land of an administrative unit can be used for open field PV, or on- and offshore wind farms, we divide Europe into a 10 arcsecond grid, whose cell size varies with the longitude but never exceeds 0.09 km^2^. For each cell we obtain the current land cover and use from the GlobCover 2009 dataset [@EuropeanSpaceAgency:2010], the average slope of the terrain from SRTM and GMTED [@Reuter:2007; @Danielson:2011] or its maximum water depths from ETOPO1 [@Amante:2009], and whether it belongs to an area which is environmentally protected  from the World Database on Protected Areas [@UNEP-WCMC:2018]. We additionally use the European Settlement Map (ESM) with 6.25 m^2^ resolution [@Ferri:2017] to classify an entire 10-arcsecond cell as built-up area if more than 1% of its land area are buildings or urban parks. We use land cover and use, slope, protected areas, and settlements as decision criteria because these constraints have been found to be the most relevant for land eligibility studies in Europe [@Ryberg:2018]. For each potential type there is a set of rules by which we define if a cell is eligible for renewable electricity generation and if yes, for which type. These rules are described below.

### Roofs for PV

The potential of roof-mounted PV not only depends on the amount of roof areas available, but also on the orientation and the tilt of those roofs. We analytically derive the rooftop areas in each unit. We then use a dataset of Swiss roofs, taking it as representative for Europe as a whole, to correct the area estimation and to amend it with tilt and orientation statistically.

We use the European Settlement Map [@Ferri:2017] to identify the amount of rooftop area in each unit. The map is based on satellite images of 2.5 m resolution and employs auxiliary data e.g. on population or national data on infrastructure to automatically classify each cell as building, street, urban green, etc. For each 10 arcsecond cell we sum up the space that is classified as buildings. We consider only those cells that we initially classified as built-up areas before, and which are hence not used for other renewable generation.

We then amend this first estimation with data from sonnendach.ch for Switzerland [@SwissFederalOfficeofEnergy:2018]. We use this dataset in two ways. First, we improve the area estimation taken from the European Settlement Map. Sonnendach.ch data is based on high-resolution 3D models of all buildings in Switzerland and thus allow for estimations of roof areas with high accuracy. For the roofs included in the sonnendach.ch dataset, the European Settlement Map identifies 768 km^2^ building foot prints, where sonnendach.ch finds 630 km^2^ roof area. Sonnendach.ch also apply expert estimation of unavailable parts of the roof, e.g. those covered with windows or chimneys [@SwissFederalOfficeofEnergy:2016], which reduces the theoretically available rooftop areas from 630 km^2^ to 432 km^2^. Thus, for Switzerland, using ESM data only may overestimate the realistic potential by as much as 74%. We assume this overestimation is representative for all Europe and apply the factor of 0.74 to all areas identified by the European Settlement Map.

The second use we make of the Swiss data is to identify the tilt and orientation of the roof areas. For that, we cluster all roofs in 17 categories: flat roofs, and roofs with south-, west-, north-, and east-wards orientation with 4 groups of tilt each. We then quantify the relative area share of each category (see Table @tbl:roof-statistics). Again, we assume the distribution of these attributes of the Swiss housing stock is representative for Europe and apply it to all administrative units.

### Renewable electricity yield

Based on the previous steps we can quantify the amount of land in each administrative unit that is eligible for generation of renewable electricity. To estimate the annual generation for wind power, we first assume a capacity density of 8 MW/km^2^ (15 MW/km^2^) based on a rated capacity of 2 MW/unit (10 MW/unit) for onshore (offshore) wind [@EuropeanEnvironmentAgency:2009] which allows us to derive the installable capacity for each unit. We then use historically observed capacity factors per NUTS2 unit from Renewables.ninja [@Staffell:2016] to determine the annual electricity yield from installable capacity. For offshore wind and for countries in which data on the NUTS2 level are not available (Western Balkans, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, and Luxembourg), we use data from the same source on the national level.

For open field PV and flat roof-mounted PV, we assume a capacity density of 80 MW~p~/km^2^ based on a module efficiency of 16% and space demand of two times the module area as an average for all Europe. Furthermore, we assume modules are installed southward facing and with tilt optimisation as defined by [@Jacobson:2018]. For PV of tilted roofs, we assume a capacity density of 160 MW~p/km^2^ based on a module efficiency of 16%. Using the statistical model from Table @tbl:roof-statistics we define 16 different deployment situations. We then use Renewables.ninja [@Staffell:2016; @Pfenninger:2016] to simulate the average renewable electricity yield of the years 1996-2016 of each deployment situation in each administrative unit of the regional level. In Switzerland for example, this leads to 442 simulated time series, based on 17 deployment situations in 26 cantons. We assume a performance ratio of 90%.

### Technical potential

We first assess the technical potential which is only restricted by technological constraints. To quantify it, we use the following rules: We allow wind farms to be built on farmland, forests, open vegetation and bare land with slope below 20°. An example of exclusion layers for Romania is shown in Figure @fig:exclusion-layers. We furthermore allow open field PV to be built on farmland, vegetation and bare land with slope below 3°.  Where onshore wind farms and open field PV can be built, we choose the option with the higher electricity yield. Lastly, we allow offshore wind farms to be built in water depths of less than 50m. Grid cells identified as built-up area can never be used for open field PV or wind farms, only for roof-mounted PV.

![Exclusion layers for determining the potential of wind power in Romania: shaded areas are not available for electricity generation (the technical potential ignores environmental protection).](../build/exclusion-layers-ROU.png){#fig:exclusion-layers .class}

### Technical-social potential

The technical potential defines an upper bound to the electricity that can be generated in each administrative unit. However, it is a strong overestimation of a realistic potential: in our case, it allows onshore wind and open field PV to be built on all environmentally protected areas, which might not only have severe consequences for the local flora and fauna, but may also breach the directives on habitats [@EuropeanUnion:1992] and birds [@EuropeanUnion:2010] of the European Union and national and regional laws as well. The technical potential also allows open field PV to be built on farmland causing land use conflicts with food and feed production. Finally, it permits use of all eligible land, potentially leading to very high densities of electricity generation. In some parts of Europe this leads to all eligible land being covered with PV modules or wind turbines, which is not realistic.

Therefore we introduce a socially and ecologically constrained potential, in which we prohibit the use of environmentally protected land and prohibit open field PV on farmland. Open field PV can only be built on bare and unused land. Furthermore, only 10% of all available surface area can be built upon, including water surface for offshore wind. We do still allow the use of all eligible roof areas for the generation of solar power, as there is little conflict potential in that case.

### Necessary land use

Finally, we assess the amount of land necessary to reach electricity autarky. This allows to study one important implication of electricity autarky: its land foot print. Furthermore, assessing the necessary land use for electricity autarky reduces uncertainty compared to assessing the technical-social potential. Quantifying the potential for every administrative unit in Europe has large uncertainties: the assessment is very sensitive to some of the assumptions which in turn may vary between regions in Europe and which are highly uncertain, in particular the amount of eligible land that can be used for electricity generation [@Holtinger:2016]. When we assess the necessary land use, we do not need to make this assumption: instead, it is the result of our analysis.

We assume most of the technical potential to be available but we prohibit open field PV on farmland. Because we focus on land use and to avoid making assumptions on availability of water surfaces, we ignore offshore wind potentials. We prioritise roof-mounted PV as it does not require land: first, we fulfil demand as much as possible with electricity from roof-mounted PV. Then, we compare the remaining demand to the potential of open field PV and onshore wind to derive the share of the non-built-up land that is necessary to fulfil demand with renewable electricity which is generated locally.

## Current electricity demand

We relate the renewable electricity potential to current electricity demand. We use country-wide demand data from 2017 for each country [@OpenPowerSystemData:2018] originally published by ENTSO-E. For subnational levels, we allocate the national demand based on population distribution and the size and location of electricity-intensive industries. We subtract industrial demand of electricity intensive industry from national demand and assume the remainder is spatially distributed over the country proportional to population. We hence assume that each person in each country is on average responsible for the same amount of electricity demand from non-electricity intensive industries, commerce, and households. We use the Global Human Settlement Population Grid which maps population in 2015 with a resolution of 250 m [@JRC:2015] in Europe and globally. It is based on national censuses and population registers. With that, we define the local, annual electricity demand in each administrative unit of each administrative level.

### Electricity intensive industry

We derive a dataset of electricity intensive industries from the European Emission Trading Scheme (ETS) [@EuropeanEnvironmentAgency:2018]. Using ETS data means we are neglecting industries in Switzerland and the Western Balkan countries which do not take part in the scheme. We consider only steel, aluminium, and chloralkali process facilities, which are individually responsible for more than 0.5% of the respective ETS activity (covering ~90% of all activity). Based on the ETS address registry and manual research, we identify the exact location of those facilities.

As there is no comprehensive and consistent dataset for industrial production, we make two important assumptions to determine each installation's production and hence electricity demand. First, we assume that the product output of each plant is homogenous, corresponding to “steel”, “aluminium”, etc. We do thus not differentiate between types of steel or aluminium products. Each product comes with a generic electricity intensity factor (MWh/t output) which we derive from [@Ecorys:2009; @Paulus:2011; @Eurofer:2015; @Klobasa:2007; @EAA:2012; @Eurochlor:2014]. Second, we assume that the production of each facility is directly proportional to its emissions: a factory emitting 10% of the ETS activity’s CO~2~ emissions (after all installations contributing 0.5% or less have been removed) is assumed to produce 10% of the output of all facilities in the filtered list under each ETS activity. To quantify annual European production we take industry organisation data [@Eurofer:2015; @EAA:2012; @Cembuerau:2015; @Eurochlor:2014; @Paulus:2011] for the most recent year available. For chloralkali plants, we assume the lowest electricity intensity in the range given by @Klobasa:2007, given the efficiency improvements (-8% intensity reduction since 2001) over the last decade [@Eurochlor:2014].

# Results

## Technical potential

On the **European level**, the technical potential of roof-mounted PV, open field PV, and on- and offshore wind is vast: technically, these technologies could generate almost 160,000 TWh/a. This exceeds the European demand of 3,200 TWh/a in 2017 almost 50 times. The largest contribution to this potential stems from open field PV (47%), followed by onshore and offshore wind.

On the **national level**, the technical potential exceeds demand in all countries, but it also becomes apparent that the potentials and the density of demand are unevenly distributed across the continent. For example, the technical potential in Latvia exceeds demands by 300 times, whereas it is only  3 times higher than the national demand in Switzerland.

On the **regional level**, the technical potential is sufficient for almost all regions. In a few cases --- the first-level administrative units with all or almost all of its area within densely populated city borders (Bruxelles, Basel, Oslo, and Vienna) --- the potential is insufficient; further, a number of cities (e.g. Berlin, Genève, Prague) have potentials only slightly higher than their demand. Hence, on this level, resource constraints start to become an issue in a few cases, whereas the technical potential is clearly high enough in almost all regional cases.

Despite the vast European potential, the **municipal level** often sees too small technical potentials to allow for autarky. Although almost all --- about 98% --- of the municipalities have a technical potential exceeding current demand (see Figure @fig:sufficient-potentials-map-technical), about 10% of Europe's population would be undersupplied. It is largely an issue of densely populated municipalities: 98% of the impacted population lives in municipalities with a population density higher than 1000 people per km^2^. Using the definition of the European Commission and the OECD of the degree of urbanisation (DEGURBA) [@Dijkstra:2014], 93% of the impacted population lives in cities, 7% in towns and suburbs, and none in rural areas.

Figure @fig:normed-potentials-boxplots-technical shows the ranges of relative technical potential for all countries when assuming autarky on the municipal level. It shows how some countries have better prerequisites for electricity autarky on this level than others: in Montenegro for example, almost everyone lives in municipalities with very high potential; a situation which is similar in other Balkans countries and also Cyprus. Other countries like Switzerland, United Kingdom, Ireland, and Greece have a quarter of their population living in municipalities with a potential lower than or close to their current demand and are hence less suited for autarky on the municipal level. The figure furthermore shows that the relative potential varies largely within countries: in Greece for example, despite the low potential it has to offer for a quarter of its population, the majority of the remaining population lives in municipalities where the potential exceeds demand 20 times. Countries with such high variability would be better off by combining municipalities with low potential with those with high potential to achieve sufficient levels for everyone.

Outliers (2.5% below and above each whisker) are not depicted.](../build/technical-potential/normed-potentials-boxplots.png){#fig:normed-potentials-boxplots-technical .class}

## Technical-social potential

When applying the constraints of the technical-social potential, the total potential on the **European level** is 14,000 TWh/a and hence exceeds today's electricity demand more than 4 times. Because the constraints do not limit roof-mounted PV, this is now the dominant technology (34%), followed by open field PV and on- and offshore wind. Even with strict social constraints, Europe's potential of renewable electricity is high enough for Europe to become electricity autarkic with only renewables.

Also on the **national level**, all countries in Europe reveal sufficient potentials: while the technical-social potential, similar to the technical potential, is not equally distributed over Europe, even the lowest relative potential (Switzerland) is 50% higher than the national demand. Again, we find the highest relative potential in Latvia (1800% of the national demand).

On the **regional level**, we find the lowest relative potentials in subnational regions within city borders. Oslo reveals the lowest potential, with less than a quarter of its demand supplied with local generation, but also other urban areas have an insufficient technical-social potential, including: Île-de-France (Paris region), Dublin, and Berlin, see Figure @fig:sufficient-potentials-map-technical-social. Almost all --- 97% --- of all 502 first-level administrative units holding 95% of Europe's population have a technical-social potential which exceeds their local demand of today and hence could, at least in principle, be self-sufficient in renewable electricity.

![Administrative units where the technical-social potential exceeds electricity demand (light/green) and where it does not (dark/red), on all four administrative levels. For each level the text box furthermore shows from top to bottom: the name of the level, the fraction of undersupplied administrative units, and the fraction of the European population living in undersupplied administrative units. ](../build/technical-social-potential/sufficient-potentials-map.png){#fig:sufficient-potentials-map-technical-social .class}

Applying **municipal level** electricity autarky, about 84% of the population lives in the 90% of municipalities where the technical-social potential exceeds current demand. The majority of those undersupllied --- 90% --- lives in municipalities with a population density above 1000 people per km^2^. According to the DEGURBA definition, 85% of the affected population lives in cities, 12% in towns and suburbs, and only 2% lives in rural areas. In undersupplied rural municipalities, national parks or natural reserves often cover a large share of the area, making it impossible to supply even a small population with sufficient amounts of renewable electricity. Others have high industrial demand. Overall, however, whether the technical-social renewables potential is sufficient or not is thus almost only a function of population density.

Figure @fig:normed-potentials-boxplots-technical-social shows the ranges of technical-social potential for all countries when assuming autarky on the municipal level. It shows that for several countries, more than a quarter of the population lives in municipalities with insufficient potential. Should the actually realisable potential be lower the technical-social potential, many countries will see many more municipalities with insufficient potentials. The figure also shows that there are very high relative potentials in Europe, with the median person living in a municipality with a potential more than twice as high as their current electricity demand.

## Necessary land use

The result of assessing the necessary land use for electricity autarky are shown in Table @tbl:necessary-land-100. Because we prioritise roof-mounted PV, land use is generally very low: on the European and national level it is always smaller than 1% of the non-built-up areas. On the regional and municipal levels there are some administrative units which need all or more of their non-built-up area, but on average the land use is very low as well. The reason for such limited land needs is the abundant source of electricity from roof-mounted PV which is in many cases able to fulfil the electricity demand on its own.

Many electricity scenarios for Europe comprise much lower shares of PV and roof-mounted PV (see Discussion): in [@EuropeanCommission:2016a; @FraunhoferIEE:2017; @Greenpeace:2012] for example, the share of PV is below 40%. When we consider 40% of the electricity demand as a hard limit to the generation of electricity from roof-mounted PV in each administrative unit, we obtain the results as given in Table @tbl:necessary-land-40. Compared to the unconstrained case, average land use is much higher on the regional and municipal level, where it increases on average by a factor of 5. For European and national levels, it remains relatively low with only 3% of built-up areas needed on average in the former case, and up to 10% for single countries. Figure @fig:necessary-land-map-40 visualises the land use of all units on all four administrative levels. It shows how land use becomes more concentrated the smaller the autarky level becomes as generation is moving closer to demand centres.

The availability of roof-mounted PV clearly has a major impact on land use. In Figure @fig:necessary-land-all-layers we thus show results for other diffusions levels of roof-mounted PV from a population centred perspective. The figure shows the fraction of the European population that lives in administrative units with high electricity generation density which we define as units where a third or more of the non-built-up area is used for electricity farming through wind turbines or open field PV. Restricting roof-mounted PV generally exposes larger parts of the population to generation density: the share of population living in generation dense municipalities more than doubles when roof-mounted PV is restricted to 40% compared to the unrestricted case. Furthermore, autarky on lower levels also exposes larger parts of the population to generation density: for the same 40% restriction case, the population living in generation dense municipalities is 7 times larger than the population living in generation dense regions; while on the national and European levels no one is exposed to generation density.

# Discussion and Conclusion

We have shown that the potential for renewable electricity --- a necessary condition for electricity autarky --- is high enough for Europe as a whole and also for each individual country to supply themselves with 100% renewable electricity, but in some cases too low to satisfy current demand on the municipal or regional level. The potential is a binding constraint especially when applying social and ecological boundaries: in this case, up to 16% of the European population would not be supplied with enough renewable electricity. Areas which are unlikely to be able to become autarkic are those with high population density, where non-built-up land is sparse and where high electricity demand asks for high magnitudes of generated electricity.

A second key finding in our study is that, although most regions and municipalities have sufficiently high potentials to supply themselves, places with high population density must use large shares, sometimes very large shares or almost all, of the remaining land for electricity generation if they seek to  become autarkic. Increasing the geographical scope of the electricity supply greatly relives the pressure on the non-built-up land --- which often already is strongly under pressure. On these higher geographical levels, generation does not need to happen in spatial proximity of demand and can either be more equally distributed on the land, and/or moved to areas with fewer use conflicts. Both findings have shown to be sensitive to the assumed dispersion rate of roof-mounted photovoltaics: large potentials of this technology will improve the situation for lower autarky levels as demand for non-built-up land is reduced.

## Uncertainties and future research

There are trends in the European electricity system that can have a significant effect on our results. On the one hand there are technological improvements which will increase the potential of renewable electricity and thus help facilitate autarky also on the lower levels. In our study, we used optimistic wind turbine and PV system parameters, which are ahead of the current state of the art,  without being bold assumptions --- but technology may evolve further than what we expect today and pave the way for autarky. The opposite, that future technology is worse than what we have today, appears highly unlikely.

On the other hand, there are divergent trends in the electricity demand: energy efficiency is pushed not only by proponents of autarky [@Rae:2012; @Muller:2011] but also by the European Commission [@EuropeanCommission:2012a] and, if current policy plans are successful, the European electricity demand would decrease over time. That would increase the chances for autarky on all levels, at least from a resource perspective. However, many expect that electricity demand will increase as the heat and transport sectors are electrified (TODO: add SOURCES).  In its reference scenario for 2050 [@EuropeanCommission:2016a], the European Commission projects an increase of electricity demand of 25% in the period 2015-2050, assuming already ratified energy efficiency policies only. A strong demand increase would complicate autarky. We can only speculate which trends will be dominant: technological improvements on the supply side and energy efficiency measures on the demand side, or rising electricity demand through electrification of the heat and transport sectors. Assuming a conservative 25% increase in demand, supply technology enhancements in particular for photovoltaics are likely to be en par if not dominant [@InternationalEnergyAgency:2010; @Philipps:2017], indicating that relative potentials might as well be higher in the future than considered in this study.

The potential for renewable electricity we assessed is a necessary condition for electricity autarky, but not a sufficient one. This means that areas for which we identified a potential higher than the current demand may in fact not be able to reach autarky. In that sense our approach allows us to reject the possibility of autarky if the demand is larger than the potential, but it does not allow us to confirm its feasibility. To confirm the technical feasibility of autarky, we would have to take further technical factors into account: restrictions in the distribution grid or the transmission grid, grid service requirements, and balancing of fluctuating renewables. Temporal fluctuations of renewable electricity can be balanced by spatial smoothing through larger grids or by temporal smoothing through storage. The problem of balancing, which we did not consider here, will thus greatly impact the feasibility of autarky on different levels.

We furthermore did not consider economic restrictions and instead used every available wind and solar resource, independent of its quality and cost. Because generation in many places will have high costs, especially if the wind or solar resource is low, the economic potential will be lower than the technical-social potential we used. Further, the method of balancing fluctuating renewable generation will contribute to total costs and the reduced potential of spatial balancing on lower geographical levels may complicate feasibility of autarky. For our analysis, cost aspects were not relevant, but they must be considered by any analysis that confirms feasibility of electricity autarky in a certain area.

The third, and likely most uncertain type of restrictions are socio-political --- in particular public and political acceptance of renewable power projects and grid expansion, as shown e.g. by [@Holtinger:2016]. Not only is the impact of acceptance difficult to assess generally, but also it may vary drastically between different parts of Europe depending on local preferences and the style of decision-making, and it may vary over time. However, our main findings are not sensitive to this type of uncertainty. Our results show the relative difference between administrative levels which is largely driven by the geographic scale of each administrative level and the population distribution --- a finding that is unaffected by any further social or economic constraints.

## Policy implications

While renewable electricity resources are abundant in Europe, electricity autarky below the national level is not possible everywhere: some regions and municipalities have insufficient potential or need large fractions or all of their non-built-up land to become autarkic. A workaround for this issue could be to form electricity regions in which urban areas cooperate with their surrounding municipalities. In such electricity regions the surrounding municipalities could generate surplus energy and export it into the city. The necessary size of such electricity regions is unknown and depends on the current and maximum density of the surrounding municipalities.

Even if forming electricity regions is an option, our results show how they would lead to high generation density in and around the urban area as supply must be in close spatial proximity of demand. Even without electricity generation, these metropolitan areas already are under high pressure on non-built-up land and electricity generation would cause further pressure and potential land use conflicts. Electricity autarky on the national level or above allows to generate electricity far from demand and electricity generation can hence distributed more freely, but at the expense of the experienced freedom and local value creation that could originate in more local autarky.

Very high shares of building integrated PV, for example by using all rooftops for electricity generation, and/or by additionally using the façades of buildings, and/or by technological improvements and higher efficiencies would ease autarky on lower levels, but only assuming balancing issues of electricity systems with very high PV shares of more than 80% can be handled. There is no study that has investigated that for all Europe, but case studies have already shown this to be difficult for single regions and we expect that balancing costs would be high, if it would at all be feasible to store such vast amounts of solar electricity from summer to winter.

Instead, our results suggest high rates of self-sufficiency should be aspired instead of full electricity autarky, where electricity is generated locally as much as possible and without causing pressure on non-built-up land, and electricity imports from neighbouring regions or countries are used to satisfy the remaining demand. In such a system, benefits of local generation can be combined with benefits of cooperation by which electricity can be generated on land with fewer use conflicts. Such a system structure is in line with suggestions from former studies [@Battaglini:2009]. To reach a system like that, energy policy must support local generation but in the same time build up a framework for electricity cooperation in Europe.
