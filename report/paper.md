# Introduction

Renewable energy, nuclear energy, and fossil fuels combustion amended by carbon capture and storage all are options to decarbonise the energy system in Europe. Among those three, renewable energy is the only option to not deplete the energy resource stock it depends on, but its resource offers another unique characteristic: it is available everywhere in some form or another. This allows to generate energy locally, decreases energy imports, and in an extreme case it allows to become energy autarkic, i.e. get rid of energy imports altogether. This is in stark contrast to today's situation, in which the European Union relies on imports for more than half of its energy [@eurostat:2016], with some member states importing more than 90% of their energy. A transition to renewable energy would hence not only allow the European Union, its member states, or regions in Europe to decarbonise their energy systems but also to become autarkic.

Proponents of local energy generation bring up the benefits of increased energy security, improvements to the local economy and its sustainable development, and community involvement. Local generation is understood as a reliable source of energy whose supply but also price is controlled within own borders. As such it decreases the dependency on others and increases the own energy security [@Abegg:2011]. Positive effects on the local economy are expected by the fact that value addition happens within the region which might decrease the out flow of capital. Installation of energy units and their maintenance and operation is furthermore expected to create jobs [@Abegg:2011][@Muller:2011]. The attractiveness of the regions could be strengthened and thereby counteract emigration in peripheral regions and promote tourism [@Abegg:2011][@Muller:2011]. Lastly, the involvement of the local community in the transition process has shown to improve the willingness to change and reduce public opposition [@Muller:2011; @Rae:2012].

There are also arguments against local autarky, some of which are discussed by @Schmidt:2012 for autarky on a small scale: the energy demand may rise due to an inherently less efficient use of resources, for example when energy cannot be used or stored locally at the time it is generated. Positive effects on the local economy might be balanced out by the need to import technologies as long as manufacturing does not happen within the local economy and necessary resources need to be imported. Lastly, in their study @Schmidt:2012 show that the land footprint for energy generation is high and can lead to land use conflicts, for example with local food or feed production.

Evidence for or against energy autarky in Europe is often collected through case studies on communal level [@Rae:2012; @Muller:2011; @Abegg:2011; @Schmidt:2012] but research is needed on the European level to understand whether and where autarky should be targeted and if yes on which level.

Autarky based on renewable energy is only feasible if enough energy can be generated locally, i.e. the local potential of renewable energy is at least as high as the demand. A sufficient potential is hence a necessary condition for autarky and as such a crucial aspect to consider when targeting autarky in any region. There are different ways of quantifying potentials and depending on the definition, the outcome can vary a lot. A common definition is the one from [@Hoogwijk:2004], which distinguishes between the theoretical, geographical, technical, and economic potential. The first is defined as the magnitude of the resource in the region, for example the total energy content of wind. The second is defined as the land area suitable for energy generation typically excluding, for example, environmentally protected areas. The part of the theoretical potential on the eligible land that can be transformed to a usable form, e.g. electricity or heat, represents the technical potential. Lastly the part of the technical potential economically viable is called the economic potential. There are other definitions though: for example in [@EuropeanEnvironmentAgency:2009] the technical potential incorporates all land on which wind turbines can be build without considering constraints from environmental protection. It can hence be understood as the theoretic potential only constrained by technical aspects. Furthermore, definition frameworks are often vague as their classes overlap: for example technical constraints cannot always be clearly distinguished from economic constraints. Also some potentials depend on the time horizon considered, in particular technical as well as economic potentials as technologies evolve and costs decrease. Those aspects need to be considered when interpreting potential estimations of renewable energy.

Solar and wind resources have the highest theoretical potential globally and in Europe [@Cho:2010] and accordingly their constrained potentials are often assessed in order to understand whether autarky is possible on the European level. An early study estimating the potential of electricity from onshore wind in Europe [@Hoogwijk:2004] finds a geographical potential of 530,000 km^2^, a technical potential of 4400 TWh/a, which corresponds roughly to 1.5 times the annual electricity demand in 2001, and an economic potential of not more than 2100 TWh/a, or 0.72 times the demand. A different definition of potentials and a different target year is used by [@EuropeanEnvironmentAgency:2009] leading to drastically different results. The study quantifies the technical and environmentally and economically constrained potential of electricity from on- and offshore wind in Europe. They find a technical potential of 45000 TWh/a for onshore wind in 2030, a potential that is 10-11 times the projected demand. Adding environmental restrictions to the onshore potential has little effect and reduces it to 39000 TWh/a. Lastly, when considering costs and using only the locations which are economically viable leaves 27000 TWh/a in 2030 or 6 times the projected demand. A more recent study [@McKenna:2015] finds a technical potential of 20000 TWh/a for the same countries. While these estimates vary widely from 4400 TWh/a to 39000 TWh/a of environmentally constrained potential, they all agree that onshore wind power could supply a major fraction or all of Europe's electricity demand.

Similar studies have been performed to assess the technical potential of roof mounted photovoltaics (PV) in Europe. Based on statistical information about the building stock and based on solar irradiation data, [@Defaix:2012] estimate a technical potential of 840 TWh/a for the EU-27 including PV mounted on facades, or 22% of the projected demand in 2030. A recent analysis [@Huld:2018] mixes a statistical approach with an analytical one: based on high resolution satellite images for a few cities in Europe they derive a statistical roof model which they then apply to the entire EU-28 using population density as a proxy. This way they find a technical potential for roof mounted PV of 1500 TWh/a, or  35% of the projected demand. These studies show that roof-mounted PV can contribute significantly to supply Europe's electricity needs, albeit at a much lower magnitude than onshore wind.

Some of the studies with European scope disaggregate their results on the national level, allowing this way to assess the renewable potential in light of national autarky [@EuropeanEnvironmentAgency:2009; @Defaix:2012; @McKenna:2015]. Other studies have assessed the potential for single countries, e.g. wind in Germany [@McKenna:2014], Spain [@Fueyo:2010], Sweden [@Siyal:2015], and Austria [@Holtinger:2016]. While all of those roughly agree with the results from the analyses on the European level and reveal potentials which are close to or exceeding today's electricity demand, [@Holtinger:2016] shows the uncertainty of social constraints by involving key stakeholders and decision-makers in the progress of defining them. Their results range from 3.9 TWh/a or ~6% of today's electricity demand to 92.8 TWh/a or 147%. Similarly, there are several assessments of national potentials of roof-mounted PV, e.g. 1262 TWh/a [@Quaschning:2000] and 148 TWh/a (residential buildings only) [@Mainzer:2014] for Germany or 17.86 TWh/a [@Assouline:2017] and 53.2 TWh/a [@Buffat:2018] for Switzerland. Part of differences of those results can be explained by different definitions of potentials, other parts by the employed methods. Not for all countries studies are available and thus a European perspective on national potentials is only given by [@EuropeanEnvironmentAgency:2009; @Defaix:2012; @McKenna:2015].

Renewable potentials on subnational levels are given as disaggregated results by [@Assouline:2017; @McKenna:2014] for entire countries. Many more analyses of renewable energy potentials have been performed on the regional level, e.g. [@Jager:2016; @Ordonez:2010; @Strzalka:2012; @Brito:2012; @Bergamasco:2011]. Those allow to assess the renewable potentials and hence the feasibility of electricity autarky for single regions in Europe, but they do not allow to make general statements for all Europe.

There is no study known to us which assesses the potential of electricity from renewable sources in Europe disaggregated to a subnational level. General statements on the feasibility of electricity autarky on such a level can hence not be made. Furthermore, none of the studies compares the implications of autarky at different levels, not even between the national and the European level. In this paper, we quantify the socially and environmentally constrained potential for wind power and photovoltaics in Europe, assess the feasibility of electricity autarky in all regions on different levels, and discuss implications of decisions for certain levels of electricity autarky.

<!--- TODO justify why we consider administrative units --->

# Method

We assess the feasibility of electricity autarky for regions in Europe with own local government on four levels: European, national, regional, and municipal. For each administrative unit on each administrative level we quantify the renewable potentials and the current electricity demand. We then reject autarky based on renewable electricity for those units for which the annual demand exceeds the annual potential.

## Definition of administrative levels

To identify administrative units including their geographic shape on all levels we use data from NUTS 2013 [@eurostat:2015] and the global administrative areas database (GADM) [@GADM:2018]. The scope of our analysis is EU-28 excluding Malta for which no data was available, plus Switzerland, Norway, and the Western Balkans countries Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Macedonia, Montenegro, and Serbia. Together, all 34 countries form the European level; in isolation they form the national level, see Table @tbl:administrative-levels. Country shapes for EU-28 countries and Switzerland and Norway are defined by NUTS 2013, and for the Western Balkans countries by GADM.

The regional level is defined by the first-level administrative divisions, e.g. cantones in Switzerland, régions in France, or oblasti in Bulgaria, of which GADM identifies 493 in the study area. Lastly, there are 122672 communes which form the municipal level. These communes are defined for most countries by the Local Administrative Unit 2 (LAU2) layer of NUTS 2013, and for Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Montenegro we took their definitions from GADM. Lastly, we estimate the size of maritime areas over which regions have sovereignty by allocating Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ) to regions on all levels. We divide and allocate to all regions which share a coast with the EEZ. The share is proportional to the length of the shared coast. We use EEZ shape data from @Claus:2018.

## Renewable potential

To quantify the renewable potential in each administrative unit, we first estimate the amount of land eligible for generation of renewable electricity and then the magnitude of electrical energy that can be generated annually on the eligible land.

### Open field land eligibility

To decide which fractions of the land of an administrative unit can be used for open field PV, or on- and offshore wind farms, we divide Europe into a 10 arcsecond grid, whose cell size varies with the longitude but never exceeds 0.09 km^2^. For each cell we obtain the current land cover and use from the GlobCover 2009 dataset [@EuropeanSpaceAgency:2010], the average slope of the terrain from SRTM and GMTED [@Reuter:2007; @Danielson:2011] or its maximum water depths from ETOPO1 [@Amante:2009], and whether it belongs to an area which is environmentally protected  from the World Database on Protected Areas [@UNEP-WCMC:2018]. We additionally use the European Settlement Map with 6.25m^2^ resolution [@Ferri:2017] to classify an entire 10-arcsecond cell as built-up area if more than 1% of its land area are buildings or urban parks.

To quantify the technical potential, we use the following rules: We allow wind farms to be built on farmland, forests, open vegetation and bare land with slope below 20°. An example of exclusion layers for Romania is shown in Figure @fig:exclusion-layers. We furthermore allow open field PV to be built on farmland, vegetation and bare land with slope below 3°. Lastly, we allow offshore wind farms to be built in water depths of less than 50m. Grid cells identified as built-up area can never be used for open field PV or wind farms, only for roof-mounted PV.

The technical potential defines an upper bound to the electricity that can be generated in each region and its definition is relatively straight forward and less controversial. It is hence instructive to study. It is though a strong overestimation of any feasible potential: in our case, it allows onshore wind and open field PV to be built on all environmentally protected areas, which not only might have severe consequences for the local flora and fauna, but also might breach the directives on habitats [@EuropeanUnion:1992] and birds [@EuropeanUnion:2010] of the European Union. The technical potential also allows open field PV to be build on farmland causing land use conflicts with food and feed production, and furthermore it allows to use all of the available land, potentially leading to very high densities of energy generation. In some parts of Europe this leads to all available land being covered with PV modules or wind turbines. Such a scenario is not realistic.

To get closer to a feasible scenario we introduce a socially and ecologically constrained potential, in which we prohibit the use of environmentally protected land and we prohibit to build open field PV on farmland. Open field PV can only be build on bare and unused land. Furthermore, only 10% of all available land can be built upon, including maritime regions.

![Exclusion layers for determining the potential of wind power in Romania.](../build/exclusion-layers-ROU.png){#fig:exclusion-layers .class}

### Roofs for PV

The potential of roof-mounted PV not only depends on the amount of roof areas available, but also on the orientation and the tilt of those roofs. We analytically derive the rooftop areas in each unit. We then use a dataset of Swiss roofs, taking it as representative for Europe as a whole, to correct the area estimation and to amend it with tilt and orientation statistically.

We use the European Settlement Map (ESM) [@Ferri:2017] to identify the amount of rooftop area in each unit. The map is based on satellite images of 2.5m resolution and employs auxiliary data e.g. on population or national data on infrastructure to automatically classify each cell as building, street, urban green, etc. For each 10 arcsecond cell we sum up the space that is classified as buildings. We consider only those cells that we initially classified as built-up areas before, and which are hence not used for other renewable generation.

We then amend this first estimation with data from sonnendach.ch for Switzerland [@SwissFederalOfficeofEnergy:2018]. We use this dataset in two ways. First we improve the area estimation taken from the European Settlement Map. This estimation is less precise due to differences in methodology compared to sonnendach.ch, underestimates the area due to a lack of data on roofs' tilt, and overestimates the area as it ignores unavailable parts of the roof, e.g. those covered with windows or chimneys. For the roofs included in the sonnendach.ch dataset, the European Settlement Map identifies 768km^2^ roof areas, where sonnendach.ch finds only 630km^2^. After applying the expert estimation of available areas [@SwissFederalOfficeofEnergy:2016], this is reduced to 441km^2^ (TODO update!). Thus, for Switzerland, ESM data overestimates the actual potential hence by 74%. We assume this overestimation is representative for all Europe and apply the factor of 0.74 to all areas identified by the European Settlement Map.

The second use we make of the Swiss data is to identify the tilt and orientation of the roof areas. For that, we cluster all roofs in 17 categories: flat roofs, and roofs with south-, west-, north-, and east-wards orientation with 4 groups of tilt each. We then quantify the relative area share of each category, see Table @tbl:roof-statistics. We again assume the distribution of these attributes of the Swiss housing stock is representative for Europe and apply it to all regions.

### Renewable electricity yield

Based on the previous steps we can quantify the amount of land in each administrative unit that is eligible for generation of renewable electricity. To estimate the annual generation for wind power, we first assume a capacity density of 8 MW/km^2^ (15 MW/km^2^) based on a rated capacity of 2 MW/unit (10 MW/unit) for onshore (offshore) wind [@EuropeanEnvironmentAgency:2009] which allows us to derive the installable capacity for each unit. We then use historically observed capacity factors per NUTS2 region from renewables.ninja [@Staffell:2016] to determine the annual electricity yield from installable capacity. For offshore wind and for countries in which data on NUTS2 level is not available (Western Balkans, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, and Luxembourg), we use data from the same source on the national level.

For open field PV and flat roof-mounted PV, we assume a capacity density of 80 MW~p~/km^2^ based on a module efficiency of 16% and space demand of two times the module area as an average for all Europe. Furthermore we assume modules are installed southward facing and with tilt optimisation as defined by [@Jacobson:2018]. For PV of tilted roofs, we assume a capacity density of 160 MW~p/km^2^ based on a module efficiency of 16%. Using the statistical model from Table @tbl:roof-statistics we define 16 different deployment situations. We then use renewables.ninja [@Staffell:2016; @Pfenninger:2016] to simulate the average renewable electricity yield of the years 1996-2016 of each deployment situation in each administrative unit of the regional level. In Switzerland for example, this leads to 442 simulated time series, based on 17 deployment situations in 26 cantons. We assume a performance ratio of 90%.

The aggregated yield of onshore wind, offshore wind, open field PV and roof-mounted PV represents the technical renewable electricity potential for each administrative unit.

## Current electricity demand

We relate the renewable electricity potential to the local electricity demand of today. As a base, we are using the load data from 2017 for each country [@OpenPowerSystemData:2018] originally published by ENTSO-E. For subnational levels, we allocate the national demand based on the distribution of population in each country. We hence assume that each person in each country is on average consuming the same amount of electricity. Before allocating the national demand based on the distribution of population, we subtract industrial demand of electricity intensive industry.

### Electricity intensive industry

We derive a dataset of electricity intensive industries from the European Emission Trading Scheme (ETS). Using ETS as a base means we are neglecting industries in Switzerland and the Western Balkan countries which do not take part in the scheme. We consider only steel, aluminium, and chloralkali process facilities, which are responsible for more than 0.5% of the respective ETS activity. Based on the ETS address registry and manual research, we identify the exact location of those facilities.

As there is no comprehensive and/or consistent dataset for industry production, we make two important assumptions to determine the production, and hence the electricity demand, of each installation. First, we assume that the product output of each plant is homogenous, corresponding to “steel”, “aluminium”, etc.: we do thus not differentiate between different types of steel or different aluminium products. Hence, each product comes with a generic electricity intensity factor (MWh/t output) which we derive from [@Ecorys:2009; @Paulus:2011; @Eurofer:2015; @Klobasa:2007; @EAA:2012; @Eurochlor:2014]. Second, we assume that the production of each facility is directly proportional to its emissions: a factory emitting 10% of the ETS activity’s CO~2~ emissions (after all installations contributing 0.5% or less have been removed) is assumed to produce 10% of the output of all facilities in the filtered list under each ETS activity. As base for the yearly European production, we take industry organisation data [@Eurofer:2015; @EAA:2012; @Cembuerau:2015; @Eurochlor:2014; @Paulus:2011] for the most recent year available. For chloralkali plants, we assume the lowest electricity intensity in the range given by @Klobasa:2007, given the efficiency improvements (-8% intensity since 2001) over the last decade [@Eurochlor:2014].

### Population based demand

We use the dataset of industries to localise electricity intensive industrial demand to administrative units. We assume the remaining electricity demand of non-electricity intensive industries, commerce, and households is spatially distributed over the country proportional to population. We use the Global Human Settlement Population Grid which maps population in 2015 with a resolution of 250m [@JRC:2015] in Europe and globally. It is based on national censuses and population registers. With that, we define the local, annual electricity demand in each administrative unit of each administrative level.

# Results

## Technical potential

We first assess the technical potential of electricity generation from renewable energy at the European level. Aggregating the potential of roof mounted PV, open field PV, and on- and offshore wind results in an electricity yield of 159164 TWh/a. With an annual demand of 3203 TWh/a in 2016, this is a huge potential and exceeds the demand almost 50 times. The contribution to the technical potential of the different technologies are 4.0% from roof mounted PV, 47.5% from open field PV, 34.3% from onshore wind, and 23.5% from offshore wind, where open field PV and onshore wind compete for those areas on which both technologies can be built. Table @tbl:european-potentials gives an overview of the potentials on the European level.

```

While the potential exceeds the demand almost 50 times, the resources and the demand are not equally distributed over Europe. Hence, on the national level the technical potential is in some countries greater than in others. Latvia has the highest relative potential, with a yield that exceeds its demand more than 300 times. Switzerland has the lowest relative potential which exceeds its demand only 3.3 times. Still, such potentials allow all countries in Europe to aspire self-sufficiency.

On the regional level, the technical potential is not sufficient to supply all regions with enough electricity. The relative potentials are particularly low for those first-level administrative units, which are within city borders. Bruxelles in Belgium, Basel in Switzerland, Vienna in Austria, and Oslo in Norway are the four regions whose technical potential is too low to be self-sufficient. Other cities with a potential less than 1.5 times their current electricity demand are Berlin, Genève, and Prague.

Despite the abundant potential on the European level, there are many municipalities in Europe for which not even the tolerantly defined technical potential is sufficient to become autarkic. Roughly 2% of the 122672 municipalities are impacted, in which 11% of Europe's population lives. As from these numbers can be seen, this is largely an issue of densely populated municipalities: 98% of the impacted population lives in municipalities with a population density higher than 1000 people per squarekilometer. According to the definition of the European Commission and the OECD of the degree of urbanisation (DEGURBA) [@Dijkstra:2014], 92% of the impacted population lives in cities, 8% in towns and suburbs, and 0% in rural areas. Figure @fig:normed-potentials-boxplots-technical shows the ranges of relative technical potential for all countries. It reveals that not only the total potential per country differs significantly, but also the distribution of the country's potential onto the municipalities varies strongly between countries.

Outliers are not depicted. ](../build/technical-potential/normed-potentials-boxplots.png){#fig:normed-potentials-boxplots-technical .class}

## Social-ecological potential

The resulting potential on the European level is summarised in Table @tbl:european-potentials. The total potential is 13737 TWh/a and hence exceeds today's electricity demand more than 4 times. Roof mounted PV, open field PV, onshore wind, and offshore wind contribute with 46%, 43%, 29%, and 18% respectively to the total potential, where open field PV and onshore wind compete for the areas on which both can be built. Considering these social and environmental constraints, Europe's potential of renewable electricity is by far high enough for Europe to become electricity autarkic.

markdown: True
---
```

Also all countries in Europe reveal sufficient potentials: while the social-ecological potential, similar to the technical potential, is not equally distributed over Europe, even the lowest relative potential of Switzerland is 50% higher than the local demand. Again we find the highest relative potential in Latvia; a potential that exceeds the local demand 18 times.

Again we find the lowest relative potentials in those subnational regions which are inside city borders. Oslo reveals the lowest potential, with less than 25% of its demand supplied with local generation. Other urban areas with insufficient generation are: Bruxelles, Vienna, Basel, Prague, Genève, Île-de-France, Dublin, and Berlin. 97% of all 493 first-level administrative units have a social-ecological potential which exceeds their local demand of today and hence could be self-sufficient.

![Distribution of social-ecological potential per country and all Europe as experienced by the population when considering autarky on the municipal level: the boxes show the potential of the municipalities in which half of the population lives; centred around the median. Outliers are not depicted.](../build/social-ecological-potential/normed-potentials-boxplots.png){#fig:normed-potentials-boxplots-social-ecological .class}

While the fraction of municipalities unable to supply themselves with the social-ecological potential is only slightly higher, namely 4%, still 18% of Europe's population would be impacted. The majority of those, 91%, lives in municipalities with a population density above 1000 people per squarekilometer. According to DEGURBA, 85% of the affected population lives in cities, 12% in towns and suburbs, and only 2% lives in rural areas. Figure @fig:normed-potentials-boxplots-social-ecological plots the ranges of relative potentials for each country, and while it shows that only a small number of municipalities has insufficient supply, it also reveals that in some countries, many municipalities' potential is only slightly above their demand. This is in particular the case for Belgium, the United Kingdom and Switzerland. Should the actually feasible potential be lower than this social-ecological one, those countries will see many more municipalities with insufficient potentials. The Figure also shows that there are many municipalities with very high potentials, including in but not limited to the United Kingdom. Figure @fig:normed-potentials-map-social-ecological shows a map of Europe with all municipalities in red for which the social-ecological potential is insufficient.

## Assessing the land demand

Quantifying the potential for every region in Europe has large uncertainties: the assessment is very sensitive to some of the assumptions which in turn may vary between regions in Europe and which are highly uncertain, like the amount of available land that can be used for electricity generation [@Holtinger:2016]. So instead of asking which fraction of the demand can be satisfied with predefined potentials, we are turning the question around and are asking: Assuming all regions in Europe want to reach electricity autarky, what would be the amount of their land they would need to use for electricity generation?

![The fraction of all land needed for renewable power installations when demanding electricity autarky, for all regions on (a) European, (b) national, (c) regional, (d) municipal level. In here we assume environmentally protected land is not available for any kind of renewable power installation, and farmland is not available for open-field PV. We furthermore assume that roof-mounted PV contributes not more than 60% to satisfying electricity demand.](../build/necessary-land-map.png){#fig:necessary-land-map .class}

We will first consider municipalities only. In the following, we still prohibit the use of environmentally protected land and building PV on farmland, but allow to use all other land including farmland for onshore wind and all maritime regions for offshore wind where technically available. Figure @fig:necessary-land-municipalities shows the number of municipalities which need a certain fraction of the available land or more to become autarkic. As roof mounted PV has a large impact, we consider several scenarios in which the use of available roofs varies from 0% to 100% (FIXME like below, I think this should rather be the share of the demand than the share of the roofs to get rid of uncertainty of available roofs). For example, the Figure shows that when 0% of the roofs are used, more than half of the municipalities need more than 5% of the available land for electricity generation. The Figure reveals that for scenarios with 50% rooftops used or more, most municipalities need less than 5% of their available land. In these scenarios, using more than 5% of the available land has benefits only for a small number of municipalities. For scenarios with less than 50% of the rooftops used, large fractions of the available land (above 10%) would be needed for a significant amount of municipalities. The Figure reveals the importance of roof mounted PV and the fact that -- given sufficient roof mounted PV can be used -- the fraction of available land for electricity generation is low for most municipalities.

![Number of municipalities whose land demand for becoming autarkic is greater than a certain fraction.](../build/necessary-land.png){#fig:necessary-land-municipalities .class}

Turning our view from municipalities to the administrative levels above, we ask the question of how the land demand differs between autarky on the levels. While the total land demand obviously is the same on all levels, its distribution and   in particular the density differs. High levels like the national and European level offer the opportunity to disperse the generation units over the given land or to move it to areas which are thinly-populated, less used, and not environmentally protected. We show the ranges of available total land (FIXME should be harmonised with Figure above; either total land or available land) per level in Figure @fig:necessary-land-all-layers for different diffusion levels of roof mounted PV. We consider total land to exclude maritime regions and hence we exclude offshore wind generation as well. The national level is shown in blue, the regional level is shown in orange, and the municipal level is shown in green. The saturation of each bar shows the 25% quantile, the median, and the 75% quantile respectively. The median for all roof mounted PV shares vary only little between the levels. For the 80% case for example, half of the countries, regions, and municipalities need less than 2% of the total land. The top 25% of each level vary strongly though: while for the same case 25% of the countries need more than 2% of the total land, the same fraction of municipalities needs almost 20% of their total land. For lower diffusions of roof-mounted PV that difference becomes even more pronounced: Considering 40% diffusion of roof mounted PV for example the fractions of total land needed are more than 6% and more than 50% respectively. Using half of the total land in a municipality is very likely infeasible. The Figure shows that autarky on higher administrative levels can relieve the stress on land use for electricity generation in highly populated regions and offer the possibility to disperse the generation units more equally.

The share is shown for different diffusion levels of roof-mounted PV. Total land excludes maritime regions and hence offshore wind is not considered.](../build/necessary-land-all-layers.png){#fig:necessary-land-all-layers .class}

# Discussion

TODO somewhere here discuss future trends that might become important: rising electricity demand from heat and mobility (important), urbanisation (important, but not huge), other technologies, energy efficiency (mentioned by several proponents of autarky, e.g. [@Rae:2012][@Muller:2011]

TODO somewhere here discuss technical restrictions: distribution and transmission grid, intermittency of renewable infeed

TODO somewhere here discuss economic restrictions: LCOE e.g. from slope, access to roads, magnitude of resources (north facing rooftop pv anyone?).

TODO somewhere here discuss autarky: "Niemand hat vor, autark zu werden.". Aspiring high rates of self-sufficiency instead of autarky (which is anyway more realistic in Europe) relieves the issues shown here.

TODO somewhere here discuss the found importance on population density which in reality is lower due to industrial demand (which we ignore to good parts)

TODO discuss sensitivity of conclusions to uncertainties in the total European potential (and the methods, e.g. [@Holtinger:2016]): we do not care too much about absolute values, but the relative values between the levels are important and we claim they are insensitive (can we show that?)

# Conclusion

we have assessed the potential to generate electricity from renewable source for all Europe on different administrative levels. we show that

* potentials are in many cases too low on the municipal level, even for tolerantly defined technical potential, but even more so when adding social and ecological constraints;
* the issue is mainly driven by population density;
* higher administrative levels like the national or European allow to relieve the stress on land in regions of high demand and to disperse generation more equally.

this study is the first (is it?) to assess autarky on municipal level with European scope. considering only these results suggests to either target autarky (or rather: higher levels of self-sufficiency) on the national or European level, or use more location-specific borders for autarky (mainly cities connect with their surrounding -- future research!).

We hypothesis this result is supported by the issues of intermittency and costs, which are to be shown on the European scale. Further research also should be done on other aspects of autarky (like local value addition, jobs, etc) but on the European scale.

Thank you, good night!
