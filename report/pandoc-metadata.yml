abstract: |
    Renewable power's primary energy source is local. Hence, a transition to a renewable power system provides regions the opportunity to become electrically autarkic. We investigate this opportunity for Europe as a whole, but also for nations, regions, and municipalities in Europe. Electricity autarky is only possible when the technical potential of renewable power exceeds the local demand. We determine the technical potential of rooftop PV, PV farms, and on- and offshore wind power through an analysis of land eligibility. Land cover, elevation and slope, and protected areas determine the eligibility of land for renewable power generation. In line with previous analyses we find that the technical potential of renewable power exceeds the demand several times on the European and also the national level. The situation is different for European subnational regions, and in particular for European municipalities, where in many cases the demand exceeds the technical potential. To reach electricity autarky in these areas, local authorities of rural areas would need to lower barriers for biodiversity protection and agree to high densities of renewable power plants. Local authorities in urban areas would often need to give up the idea of electricity autarky and accept power imports from their neighbours.
