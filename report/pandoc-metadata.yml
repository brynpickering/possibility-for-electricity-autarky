abstract: |
    Because solar and wind resources are available throughout Europe, a transition towards an electricity system based on renewable energy could as well be a transition towards an autarkic one. We investigate to which extent electricity autarky on different levels is possible in Europe, from the continental, to the national, regional, and municipal levels, assuming that electricity autarky is only possible when the technical potential of renewable electricity exceeds local demand. We determine the technical potential of roof-mounted and open field photovoltaics, and on- and offshore wind turbines through an analysis of surface eligibility, considering land cover, settlements, elevation, and protected areas as determinants of surface eligibility for renewable electricity generation. In line with previous analyses we find that the technical-social potential of renewable electricity is greater than demand on the European and national levels. For subnational autarky, the situation is different: here, demand exceeds the potential in several places, an effect that is stronger the higher the population density. To reach electricity autarky below the national level, regions would need to use very large fractions or all of non-built-up land for renewable electricity generation. Subnational autarky requires electricity generation to be in close proximity to demand and thus increases the pressure on non-built-up land especially in population dense regions where pressure is already high. Our findings show that electricity autarky below the national level is not possible everywhere in Europe.
