    Because the sun shines and the wind blows everywhere in Europe, a transition towards an electricity system based on renewable energy could as well be a transition towards an autarkic one. We investigate to which extent electricity autarky on different levels is possible in Europe, from the continental, to the national, regional, and municipal levels, assuming that electricity autarky is only possible when the technical potential of renewable electricity exceeds local demand. We determine the technical potential of roof-mounted PV, open field PV, and on- and offshore wind power through an analysis of land eligibility, considering land cover, settlements, elevation, and protected areas as determinants of land eligibility for renewable electricity generation. In line with previous analyses we find that the technical-social potential of renewable electricity is greater than demand on the European and national levels. For subnational autarky, the situation is different: here, demand exceeds the potential in many places, an effect that is stronger the higher the population density. To reach electricity autarky in subnational regions, local authorities would need to use very large fractions or all of available land for renewable electricity generation. Subnational autarky couples electricity demand and supply spatially and thus increases the stress on available land especially in population dense regions where stress on land is already high. Our findings show that electricity autarky below the national level is likely not feasible everywhere in Europe.
